Fort Marcy was an adobe fortification built by, General, Stephen W. Kearny Army Dring the Mexican American War (1846-1848). On August 19, 1846, New Mexico was annexed and Mexican Govener, Juan Bautista Vigil y Alarid peaceful surrendered New Mexico to the United Staes. Soon after, United States General, Stephen W. Kearny was sent to occupie Santa Fe and would construct Fort Macry on August 26, 1846 (Purdy, 3). General Kearny named the Fort after the U.S. Secretary of War, William L. Marcy. Lieutenant William H. Emory and Jeremy F. Gilmer(Prince, 4), the subordinates of General Kearly, determained that the best place for the fort to be built was ontop of a larg hill that over looked Santa Fe and that was just 600 yards north from the Santa Fe Plaza (Purdy, 3).This was Ideal for General Kearly as he needed to both secure the U.S. possession of New Mexico and to guard against an uprising from the people. Lieutenant William H. Emory stating that the possition on top of the hill was "the only point which commands the entire town and which itself is comanded by no other" (Prince, 4).

General Kearly wrote a 1846 report to the Adjutant General of the Army at Washington staing that:  "A large number of the troops are daily employed under the direction of Lieutenant Gilmer of the Engineers in erecting a fort for the defense and protection of the city, and as this is the capital of the Territory, a new acquisition to the United States, the fort will be an important and permanent one, and I have this day named it Port Marcy, and now ask for a confirmation of it." General Kearly and Lieutenant Emory's statments illustrates the main importance of this fortification, that Fort Marcy at the time of the Mexican American War was the key to the newly aquried land and was the most important building in the area as it served as a symbole of American rule over the territory (Prince, 4).

Fort Marcy would later play its role in guarding American rule over the newly acqured land as in, January 19, 1847, Colonel Sterling Price, the commander of Fort Marcy at the time would recive word that Charles Bent, the Governor of New Mexico had been killed in the Taos Revolt. In response to this Colonel Price had sent the 1st Dragoons (mounted infantry) from fort Marcy to quell the rebelion and was sucsessful in doing so (Barbour, 22).

## Santa Fe Trails
Fort Marcy like many of the other of the fortifications in area were there in part to protect commerce and travel on the Santa Fe and the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro trail, from Native American raids. Fort Craig being just south of Socorro was the “base for Indian operations” and served this purpose during the later end of the 19th century, sending out armed esscarts with traders going along the the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro trail (Miller, 86-94). Fort Marcy would serve a similar function as it was a combat post at the cross section of two major trails and the heart of the Santa Fe Trail, Santa Fe and the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro trail. In July 1854, would conduct the surrender of the Jicarilla Apaches (Barbour, 23).

At the time of Fort Macy finished construction it stood with adobe walls that where nine feet tall and five feet thick which made the shape of a irragular shaped star. The fort also had a eight feet deep moat that ran along its wall and a log building that served as a powder house that stored explosive gun powder (Purdy, 2). The fort made up an area of about 270 feet by 80 feet and could of hold up to one thousand soldiers (Prince, 5). 

Sense the time of Fort Marcy's construction in 1847 much of the fort has eroded. The walls that made up the fort are now only several feet tall moundes of earth and the moat that ran along walls is brealy visable (Purdy, 2). The erosion of the fort was due to the lack maintenance after the U.S. took complete control of New Mexico. (Piper, 13).
