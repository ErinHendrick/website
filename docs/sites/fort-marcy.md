## History
Fort Marcy was an adobe fortification built by, General, Stephen W. Kearny Army Dring the Mexican American War (1846-1848). On August 19, 1846, New Mexico was annexed and Mexican Govener, Juan Bautista Vigil y Alarid peaceful surrendered New Mexico to the United Staes. Soon after, United States General, Stephen W. Kearny was sent to occupie Santa Fe and ordered the construction of Fort Macry on August 26, 1846 (Purdy, 3). General Kearny named the Fort after the U.S. Secretary of War, William L. Marcy. Lieutenant William H. Emory and Jeremy F. Gilmer(Prince, 4), the subordinates of General Kearly, determained that the best place for the fort to be built was ontop of a larg hill that over looked Santa Fe and that was just 600 yards north from the Santa Fe Plaza (Purdy, 3).This was Ideal for General Kearly as he needed to both secure the U.S. possession of New Mexico and to guard against an uprising from the people. Lieutenant William H. Emory stating that the possition on top of the hill was "the only point which commands the entire town and which itself is comanded by no other" (Prince, 4).

## National Historic Trails
Fort Marcy like many of the other of the fortifications in area were there in part to protect commerce and travel on the Santa Fe and the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro trail, from Native American raids. Fort Craig being just south of Socorro was the “base for Indian operations” and served this exact purpose during the later end of the 19th century, sending out armed esscarts with traders going along the the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro trail (Miller, 86-94). Fort Marcy serving as a combat post at the cross section of the Santa Fe and the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro trail, in July 1854, would conduct the surrender of the Jicarilla Apaches (Barbour, 23).

## Description Past and Present
At the time of Fort Macy finished construction it stood with adobe walls that where nine feet tall and five feet thick which made the shape of a irragular shaped star. The fort also had a eight feet deep moat that ran along its wall and a log building that served as a powder house that stored explosive gun powder (Purdy, 2). The fort made up an area of about 270 feet by 80 feet and could of hold up to one thousand soldiers (Prince, 5). 

Sense the time of Fort Marcy's construction in 1847 much of the fort has eroded. The walls that made up the fort are now only several feet tall moundes of earth and the moat that ran along walls is brealy visable (Purdy, 2). The erosion of the fort was due to the lack maintenance after the U.S. took complete control of New Mexico and that the fort was never built with the intent for it to be permanent (Piper, 13).
