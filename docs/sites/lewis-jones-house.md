%} In 19th century Missouri, it was very difficult to make a living. It was very rare and very lucky if you were able to make a steady living during this time period and those who did were able to capitalize on the benfits.

This large and comfortable house symbolizes Jones' wealth and status in Independence, Missouri and gives us a picture to how lucrative trade on the trail actually was.
