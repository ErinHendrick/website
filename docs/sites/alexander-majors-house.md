The house is situated approximately 16 feet in front of the house which is Missouri and Kansas border , the then  US border [^NPSFormi].  The house sits looking westward which was strategically chosen from the businessman's perspective as Kansas Territory were untaxed and he had huge corrals, grazing lands, oxen pens, barns, wagons and blacksmith shops in the property.[^WornallMajorsHouseMuseumsii]

## Who was Alexander Majors?

Alexander Majors (1814-1900) was born in Kentucky and moved with his parents Laurania and Benjamin Majors in 1819 to Lafayette County, Missouri and later moved to Jackson county [^WPAGuide1998ii]. In 1827, Majors father explored silver ore mine with no prominent value he returned to farming, his tales put great impression on Majors towards possibilities in [Western Frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_frontier) and to travel on the developing Santa Fe Trail. At the age of 21, Majors was married to Katherine Stalcup and  together they joined his fathers footstep into farming [^Morton2012a].

In August 1848 Majors started carrying freight from Independence to Santa Fe, New Mexico, an 800 mile distance [^Morton2012b]. Majors became the first western Missouri traders to freight supplies to Santa Fe after the [Mexican war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War), he started with 6 wagons and made a round trip in a record time 92 days. The war with the Mexico ended, military presence in the south west made the journey safer [^Godfrey1994B]. Majors had increase in opportunities and success due opening of [Oregon Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Territory) for settlement in 1848, [California gold fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Gold_Rush) in 1849, expansion of military forts  in the west through 1850ś [^Morton2012c].  

Majors was particular in hiring trustworthy people and made them to pledge that they would treat animals with kindness, use no profanity, stay sober all the time, and behave like gentlemen while they were his employee. Majors had great work ethics, great experience and he rested his oxen and men on Saturday afternoon to Monday morning and held worship services on Sundays. In 1854, Majors earned a respectable reputation as a successful freighter on the Western Missouri frontier [^Godfrey1994iii].

In 1855 he joined partnership with William H. Russell and William B. Waddell and contracted with US Government to freight supplies to army posts along Oregon and Santa Fe Trails  [^WoodMincer2000i]. They employed more than four thousand men and owned 3,500 wagons and nearly forty thousand oxen and 1000 mules [^Morton2012d]. Usually shipments were sent in a set of 25 wagons, 12 oxen, a teamster and each of that set had additional oxen, mules and men in case of emergency and soon the firm made about $300,000 profits in 1855-56 [^WPAGuide1998iii].

The house is built in 1856 on 300 acre farmstead property on the state line purchased by Majors firm. This property served both as family home and headquarters for Majors freighting company [^WPAGuide1998iv]. Two years later the contract system changed, Majors wife died and he remarried, he decided to move his family to Nebraska city in 1858 to oversee the shipments to Utah and gave away the state line property to his daughter Rebecca [^Morton2012e] [^WPAGuide1998v].

> The **Pony Express** began in April 1860 and **ran between St. Joseph, Missouri and Sacramento, California, it was a colourful chapter in American History**, which also benefited Majors freighting firm [^Godfrey1994vi].

In early 1859, with the start of Leavenworth & Pikeś Peak Express by Majors, Waddell and Russell firm which later became Central Overland California & Pikeś Peak Express company which is otherwise known as ["Pony Express"](http://ponyexpress.org/). This helped in filling the need for reduced postal service by government for budget reasons. This literally connected several dynamic western events with the commercial opportunities in the express business [^Godfrey1994v].

> **Pony express** is not the first mail service, in 13th century China had post stations 25 miles apart and stations for foot carriers 3 miles apart, but **a first time mail service attempted in America in large scale** [^Godfrey1994vii].

Pony Express first ride began on April 3rd, 1860, run from St. Joseph centers which reached 2 hours late, contained 49 letters, 5 private telegrams and few papers for San Francisco. Before it was delivered to the first rider whose identity was unknown, Majors addressed the crowd how the Pony express is a ancestor/father of transcontinental railroad [^Godfrey1994viii].

## Closing of Freighting firm and Change in Majors life

In 1862, Russell, Majors and Waddell firm closed as they were bankrupt and in scandal with U.S. Department of the Interior. Later Majors marriage and family fell apart, his second wife and child moved and changed their names due to shame and his first wife children grew up and were on their own. Majors left Nebraska and spent time in Salt Lake City and witnessed the completion of [transcontinental railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcontinental_railroad) in 1869 while he was working in the support of Union Pacific Railroads drive west later he lived for a while in Denver [^Morton2012f].

His old friend Buffalo Bill Cody arranged in publishing a book "Majors ś seventy years on the frontier" in 1893 by Rand McNally, which was one of the great narratives about the frontier west. Alexander Majors died in January 1900 in Chicago and his body was buried in Union Cemetery next to his first wife in Kansas city [^Morton2012g].

This house is one of the third oldest houses with light wood frame construction in Kansas facing towards west [^NPSFormii].

* ### Outbuildings and Grounds

The outbuildings next to the house no longer survive. There is a barn is approximately 100' to the southeast and smoke house around 40' to the north to the house. Present day we can see a well, cistern to the south of the house, a shed 20' north to the house and a cottage 60' north of the house [^NPSFormiii].

The house was sold to Mr. and Mrs. A. Louis Rhul in 1904 who later built additions to the house and owned it till 1924. The increase in residential growth, property was subdivided to development called Cresthills Acres [^Morton2012h]. The Rhul family made several [additions to the Majors house](https://dnr.mo.gov/shpo/nps-nr/70000335.pdf) and few of them are enlarging dining room and master bedroom on second floor by the addition on southern extension of 'T' and terminates in a bay. The rooms sizes increased from 15 x 17 feet to 15 x 27 feet [^NPSFormiv].

The house was turned into school and community meeting space for residential needs, partition walls between 3 chambers of the first floor were formed to make a single large space [^NPSFormv]. Later the house was set to demolition to built a new school but due to its timber framing and iron nails the cost of demolition estimated more that they ended up abandoning the house and building the school elsewhere [^Morton2012i].

## Majors house bought by his descendant

In 1930, Louisa P. Johnston, Majors's great grand-daughter travelled to visit her ancestral home and found the abandoned state of the house. She brought the house and started working on it in 1932 and for forty years she put effort in turning the property into a memorial for her ancestor and for its history. In 1945, the then Senator Harry Truman initiated a bill that the house will be purchased and maintained but the bill never passed. After many efforts of Louisa to get that funded money but couldn't succeed. Finally in 1970, [National Historic Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Historical_Association) aided by Rusell-Majors-Waddell the house got listed in register of National Historic sites [^Morton2012j].

In 1976, city of Kansas city adopted a plan to develop between Ward Parkway and State Line Road which gave 6 acre park surrounding the house but despite the plan it couldn't proceed for nearly 10 years. In 1979, Louisa Johnston died leaving the house to Terry W. Chapman who worked as the restoration architect for the house. The structural work was finished in 1983 and was a show case project in Kansas city Symphony, which provided interior finishes [^Morton2012k].
