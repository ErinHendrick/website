Waddell and contracted with US Government to freight supplies to army posts along Oregan and Santa Fe Trails _(Wood, Mincer, 2000)_ _(WPA Guide, 1998)_. They employed more than four thousand men and owned 3,500 wagons and nearly forty thousand oxen and 1000 mules _(LaDene, 2012)_. Usually shipments were sent in a set of 25 wagons, 12 oxen, a teamster and each of that set had additional oxen, mules and men in case of emergency and soon the firm made about $300,000 profits in 1855-56 _(WPA Guide, 1998)_.

### House

The house is built in 1856 on 300 acre farmstead property on the state line purchased by Majors firm and started construction of the house. This property served both as family home and headquarters for Majors freighting company _(WPA Guide, 1998)_. Two years later the contract system changed, Majors wife died and he remarried, he decided to move his family to Nebraska city in 1858 to oversee the shipments to Utah and gave away the state line property to his eldest daughter Rebecca (Mrs. Samuel Poteet)  _(LaDene, 2012)_ _(WPA Guide, 1998)_.

The Pony Express began in April 1860 and ran between St. Joseph, Missouri and Sacramento, California, it was a colourful chapter in American History, which also benefited the firm. In 1862, Russell, Majors and Waddell firm closed as they were bankrupt and in scandal with U.S. Department of the Interior _(LaDene, 2012)_.

Majors marriage and family fell apart, his second wife and child moved and changed their names due to shame and his first wife children grew up and were on their own. Majors left Nebraska and spent time in Salt Lake City and witnessed the completion of transcontinental railroad in 1869 while he was working in the support of Union Pacific Railroads drive west later he lived for a while in Denver _(LaDene, 2012)_.

The house was sold to Mr. and Mrs. A. Louis Rhul in 1904 who later built additions to the house and owned it till 1924. The increase in residential growth, property was subdivided to development called Cresthills Acres. The house was turned into school and community meeting space for residential needs. Later the house was set to demolition to built a new school but due to its timber framing and iron nails the cost of demolition estimated more that they ended up abandoning the house and building the school elsewhere _(LaDene, 2012)_.

In 1930, Louisa Johnston, Majors's great grand-daughter travelled to visit her ancestral home and found the abandoned state of the house. She brought the house and started working on it in 1932 and for forty years she put effort in turning the property into a memorial for her ancestor and for its history _(LaDene, 2012)_.

In 1945, the then Senator Harry Truman initiated a bill that the house will be purchased and maintained but the bill never passed. After many efforts of Louisa to get that funded money but couldn't succeed.

This helped in filling the need for reduced postal service by government for budget reasons. This literally connected several dynamic western events with the commercial opportunities in the express business. _(Godfrey, 1994)_

Pony express is not the first mail service, in 13th century China had post stations 25 miles apart and stations for foot carriers 3 miles apart, but a first time mail service attempted in America in that scale _(Godfrey, 1994)_.

Pony Express first ride began on April 3rd, 1860, run from St. Joseph centers which reached 2 hours late, contained 49 letters, 5 private telegrams and few papers for San Francisco. Before it was delivered to the first rider whose identity was unknown, Majors addressed the crowd how the Pony express is a ancestor/father of transcontinental railroad _(Godfrey, 1994)_.

Architectural style of the building is ![Classical revival style](http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/portal/communities/architecture/styles/classical-revival.html), two storied in light wood frame construction.

* #### Alterations to the house

The Rhul family made several ![alterations to the Majors house](https://dnr.mo.gov/shpo/nps-nr/70000335.pdf) and few of them are enlarging dining room and master bedroom on second floor by the addition on southern extension of 'T' and terminates in a bay. The rooms sizes increased from 15 x 17 feet to 15 x 27 feet. When the house was used as a school, partition walls between 3 chambers of the first floor were formed to make a single large space.

The kitchen on the east end was removed and replaced with a cellar and two stories above. The original shed roof of the south porch was converted to a deck to access second floor with a simple wooden baluster. The kitchen was converted toilets and a teachers room and north and south windows are converted to doorways.
