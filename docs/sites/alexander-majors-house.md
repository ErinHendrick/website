They employed more than four thousand men and owned 3,500 wagons and nearly forty thousand oxen and 1000 mules [^_Morton, 2012_]. Usually shipments were sent in a set of 25 wagons, 12 oxen, a teamster and each of that set had additional oxen, mules and men in case of emergency and soon the firm made about $300,000 profits in 1855-56 [^_WPA Guide, 1998_].

> The **Pony Express** began in April 1860 and **ran between St. Joseph, Missouri and Sacramento, California, it was a colourful chapter in American History**, which also benefited Majors freighting firm [^_Godfrey, 1994_].

In early 1859, with the start of Leavenworth & Pikeś Peak Express by Majors, Waddell and Russell firm which later became Central Overland California & Pikeś Peak Express company which is otherwise known as !["Pony Express"](http://ponyexpress.org/) [^_Godfrey, 1994_]. This helped in filling the need for reduced postal service by government for budget reasons. This literally connected several dynamic western events with the commercial opportunities in the express business [^_Godfrey, 1994_].

> **Pony express** is not the first mail service, in 13th century China had post stations 25 miles apart and stations for foot carriers 3 miles apart, but **a first time mail service attempted in America in large scale** [^_Godfrey, 1994_].

Pony Express first ride began on April 3rd, 1860, run from St. Joseph centers which reached 2 hours late, contained 49 letters, 5 private telegrams and few papers for San Francisco. Before it was delivered to the first rider whose identity was unknown, Majors addressed the crowd how the Pony express is a ancestor/father of transcontinental railroad [^_Godfrey, 1994_].

### Closing of Freighting firm and Change in Majors life

In 1862, Russell, Majors and Waddell firm closed as they were bankrupt and in scandal with U.S. Department of the Interior [^_Morton, 2012_]. Later Majors marriage and family fell apart, his second wife and child moved and changed their names due to shame and his first wife children grew up and were on their own. Majors left Nebraska and spent time in Salt Lake City and witnessed the completion of [transcontinental railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcontinental_railroad) in 1869 while he was working in the support of Union Pacific Railroads drive west later he lived for a while in Denver [^_Morton, 2012_].

The house was sold to Mr. and Mrs. A. Louis Rhul in 1904 who later built additions to the house and owned it till 1924. The increase in residential growth, property was subdivided to development called Cresthills Acres [^_Morton, 2012_]. The Rhul family made several [additions to the Majors house](https://dnr.mo.gov/shpo/nps-nr/70000335.pdf) and few of them are enlarging dining room and master bedroom on second floor by the addition on southern extension of 'T' and terminates in a bay. The rooms sizes increased from 15 x 17 feet to 15 x 27 feet [^_NHRF-1969, MAJOR)_].

The house was turned into school and community meeting space for residential needs, partition walls between 3 chambers of the first floor were formed to make a single large space [^_NHRF-1969, MAJOR)_]. Later the house was set to demolition to built a new school but due to its timber framing and iron nails the cost of demolition estimated more that they ended up abandoning the house and building the school elsewhere [^_Morton, 2012_].

### Majors house bought by his descendant

In 1930, Louisa P. Johnston, Majors's great grand-daughter travelled to visit her ancestral home and found the abandoned state of the house. She brought the house and started working on it in 1932 and for forty years she put effort in turning the property into a memorial for her ancestor and for its history [^_Morton, 2012_]. In 1945, the then Senator Harry Truman initiated a bill that the house will be purchased and maintained but the bill never passed. After many efforts of Louisa to get that funded money but couldn't succeed. Finally in 1970, [National Historic Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Historical_Association) aided by Rusell-Majors-Waddell the house got listed in register of National Historic sites [^_Morton, 2012_].

In 1976, city of Kansas city adopted a plan to develop between Ward Parkway and State Line Road which gave 6 acre park surrounding the house but despite the plan it couldn't proceed for nearly 10 years [^_Morton, 2012_]. In 1979, Louisa Johnston died leaving the house to Terry W. Chapman who worked as the restoration architect for the house. The structural work was finished in 1983 and was a show case project in Kansas city Symphony, which provided interior finishes [^_Morton, 2012_].
