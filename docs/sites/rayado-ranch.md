### Rayado Ranch was one of the first settlement camps in Colfax County New Mexico along the historic Santa Fe Trail. Rayado is a spanish word which translates to streaked. Rayado Ranch was an important trading area because there were few other trading communities in the vicinity. This settlement is located about 10 miles south of Cimarron, New Mexico on highway 21. Rayado Ranch was home to a few building and one of them is the most famous Ranch style home that Lucien Maxwell built in 1849 for his family. Rayado Ranch also had a working post office that was open only from 1873 to about 1911. The ranch also had a federal garrison post from 1850 to 1854 till Fort Union was erected in Mora, NM. the Garrison post was created on the ranch because of the area they were in was inhabited by many plains Native Americans that stole horses and other goods. Cemetery. The cemetery here in Rayado has 14 people buried there. it is approximately .2 miles west of the Kit Carson Museum. Some of the people buried there date back to the late 1860's and the last person burried there was even in the 1990's. The Ranch also included a small chapel or church called the Chapel of the Holy Child.

## Lucien Maxwell

### Lucien Maxwell founded Rayado New Mexico in 1848 shortly after the Mexican American War he settled here with his wife who shortly after gave birth to their child at the ranch. Maxwell married into land and also made deals to obtain even more. by the time he came to Rayado Ranch to start a new settlement he was the owner of the largest single tract of land ever possessed by one person in the United States 1.7 million acres and decided to make the ranch his new home for him and more settlers to come. Maxwell was a friend of Kit Carson since they both fought in the Mexican American war and because Kit lived near by in Taos, NM and even ended up living in Rayado for a couple years.

## Kit Carson

### Carson lived in Rayado in 1849. Carson was a friend of Maxwell and tried starting up a community by buying stock and seed so they could create a working farm by Rayado Creek, but this was difficult at the time because of the rural area and the amount of raiding Native Americans. Found and retrieved stolen horses form Plains Natives that stole them from Rayado. In 1850 the ranch was raided by apache natives, they stole livestock, horses and killed herders which was a fatal blow to Rayado at this time, so Kit Carson was sent out with other frontiersmen to capture the horses and retrieve revenge. They ended up finding the Apaches and taking them by storm to retrieve their goods. Maxwell and Carson's idea was to put money into the ranch and build a community near the creek which Carson tried doing by investing 2000 dollars into the ranch by purchasing seed and stock to start a farming community, but sadly the area was prone to a plethora of raiding.

## Recent Rayado

### Rayado Ranch now offers a Kit Carson Museum with most of the original buildings still to see. The area was donated to the national Boy Scouts of America and is now called Philmont Scout Ranch.
