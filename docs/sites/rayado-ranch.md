Rayado Ranch was one of the first settlement camps in Colfax County New Mexico along the historic Santa Fe Trail. Rayado is a spanish word which translates to streaked. Rayado Ranch was an important trading area because there were few other trading communities in the vicinity. The Rayado Ranch was visted by many trading travelers along the Santa Fe Trail. The Ranch was used as a resting area, trading facility, and a stage stop where travelrs on the Santa Fe Trail would relax or maybe even change parts on their stagecoaches (santafetrailnm). This settlement is located about 11 miles south of [Cimarron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimarron,_New_Mexico) New Mexico on highway 21 (NPS). Rayado Ranch was home to a few buildings and one of them is the most famous Ranch style home that Lucien Maxwell started building in 1848 for his family, the original building was found in ruins and was renovated because it is an important historical landmark (NPS). Rayado Ranch also had a working post office that was open only from 1873 to about 1911. The ranch also had a federal garrison post that protected the area from different native american tribes including the Apache and Comanchee, the post was erect from 1850 to 1854 till Fort Union was erected in Mora, NM. the Garrison post was created on the ranch because of the area they were in was inhabited by many plains Native Americans that stole horses and other goods. The cemetery here in Rayado has 14 people buried there. it is approximately .2 miles west of the Kit Carson Museum (NMTTP). Some of the people buried there date back to the late 1860's and the last person burried there was even in the 1990's. The Ranch also included a small church called the Chapel of the Holy Child that still stands today and can be visited.

## Construction

[The Lucien Maxwell House](https://www.legendsofamerica.com/nm-maxwell/) was built by 1850 when Maxwell founded Rayado Ranch and proposed a settlement here in 1848. The house is a long style adobe ranch home with wooden posts and railing on the veranda. The house originally had a flat roof but untill the 1930s the house was in ruins and was rebuilt with a pitched roof and new adobe. (NPS)

The house shares the historic Rayado with other buildings like the chapel and the Martinez house which was a small shed and barn towards the back of the house, all buildings were generally built the same way in the mid 1800's in Rayado some of them are all still standing and can be visited.

Lucien Maxwell founded Rayado New Mexico in 1848 shortly after the Mexican American War he settled here with his wife who shortly after gave birth to their child at the ranch. Maxwell married into land and also made deals to obtain even more. By the time he came to Rayado Ranch to start a new settlement he was the owner of the largest single tract of land ever possessed by one person in the United States 1.7 million acres and decided to make the ranch his new home for him and more settlers to come (legendsofamerica). Maxwell was a friend of [Kit Carson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit_Carson) since they both fought in the Mexican American war and because Kit lived near by in Taos, NM and even ended up living in Rayado for a couple years.

## Kit Carson

Carson lived in Rayado in 1849. Carson was a friend of Maxwell and tried starting up a community by buying stock and seed so they could create a working farm by Rayado Creek, but this was difficult at the time because of the rural area and the amount of raiding Native Americans. In 1850 the ranch was raided by apache natives, they stole livestock, horses and killed herders which was a fatal blow to Rayado at this time, so Kit Carson was sent out with other frontiersmen to capture the horses and retrieve revenge. They ended up finding the Apaches and taking them by storm to retrieve their goods. Maxwell and Carson's idea was to put money into the ranch and build a community near the creek which Carson tried doing by investing 2000 dollars into the ranch to start a farming community, but sadly the area was prone to a plethora of raiding (legendsofamerica).

## Later Down the Line

Rayado Ranch was never that successful due to frequent raids and was a difficult place to settle because of that, later down the line Lucien Maxwell decided to move his settlement and ranch to a safer location called Cimarron. Cimarron is literally about 11 miles north of Rayado Ranch and was Maxwell's point of true settlement (santafetrailnm) (NPS).

Rayado Ranch now offers a Kit Carson Museum with most of the original buildings still to see. The area was donated to the national Boy Scouts of America and is now called Philmont Scout Ranch. The original building that is the museum today was Kit Carson's home back in the 1850's but was renovated almost 100 years later in 1949 and reopened in 1950 as a museum to portray how life was for Maxwell and Carson during there years at Rayado Ranch.
