  Baker University first opened its doors to students in November 1858, in East Central Kansas, in the city of [Baldwin](https://www.visitbaldwincity.com/). The school holds the honor of being the first university in Kansas, Old Castle Hall was the first building of Baker University, and classes were held there through 1871 [^Historic-campus-architecture-project]. Baldwin City is one of the oldest settlements in Kansas, located about 15 miles south of Lawrence, the city got its start during the opening days of Kansas Territory when it was little more than a trail stop on the Santa Fe Trail[^sometext] [Santa Fe Trail Association](https://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/douglasco/index.html).

## History 
  
  The University is named for [Osman Cleander Baker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osman_Cleander_Baker), a distinguished scholar and bishop of what is now the United Methodist Church (KHS). The university has a rich history, growing up side-by-side with the state of Kansas, Baldwin City began as a trail stop on the Santa Fe Trail named Palmyra. Palmyra, which later became a part of Baldwin was long a favorite place for repairing wagons and for rest, the added commerce of the Santa Fe Trail helped Baldwin grow enough to build a University within the city [Santa Fe Trail Association](https://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/douglasco/index.html). In the colleges long history it has survived major events such as, the Civil War, drought, floods, tornadoes, and even grasshoppers to remain one of the most popular universities in the state of Kansas [Historic Campus Architecture Project (HCAP)](http://hcap.artstor.org/cgi-bin/library?a=d&d=p153).

## Significance 

  Baker University is significant because it admitted women early on in its history, the first graduating class in 1866 contained one women, and two men [Baker University](https://www.bakeru.edu/about-baker-university/history-mission-vision/#support). President Abraham Lincoln donated $100 in 1864 during the height of the Civil War to help build Parmenter Hall, the only donation he ever gave to any university [Kansaspedia: Baker University KHS](https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/baker-university/17829).Baker University struggled through its first years due to a drought in 1860 and the Civil War, as the war funneled prospective students into military service, the first class didn't graduate until 1866 (KHS).  In 1874 a massive grasshopper plague spread across the region devouring everything in sight, they ate crops out of the ground, as well as the wool from live sheep and clothing off people's backs. Paper, tree bark, and even wooden tool handles were devoured, hoppers were reported to have been several inches deep on the ground [Kansaspedia: Grasshopper Plague of 1874](https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/grasshopper-plague-of-1874/12070).

## Construction 
 Castle Hall was erected off campus because school trustees lacked sufficient funds to build the type of permanent structure they desired and they did not want to erect a temporary structure on the campus. College officials could raise only enough funds to construct two stories of the planned three-story structure. The Palmyra Masonic lodge financed the third floor in exchange for regular use of a room for lodge meetings [Historic Campus Architecture Project (HCAP)](http://hcap.artstor.org/cgi-bin/library?a=d&d=p153). Old Castle Hall architecturally is a fine example of early Plains Vernacular architecture, it is a crudely quoined three-story rubble-stone building, originally consisted of only two stories. The third story was added later and then afterward torn off because of poor mortar joints; it was then added for a second time and remains to date [National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form (NRHP)](https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/GetAsset/NRHP/71000309_text). 

## Building uses Through the Years
  By 1871 another building was completed on campus named [Parmenter Hall](http://hcap.artstor.org/cgi-bin/library?a=d&d=p154), thus in March the students and faculty left Old Castle Hall for the new facility. The Old Castle Hall was no longer used for classes, in 1874 the president of the college, Joseph Denison, used it as his home. Other uses over the years have been mill, student rooming house, public school, and storage place for athletic materials and other college property [Historic Campus Architecture Project (HCAP)](http://hcap.artstor.org/cgi-bin/library?a=d&d=p153). The Old Castle Hall is now used as museum, showcasing not only the schools long history, but as well as houses artifacts from the State of Kansas and Methodist history.

## Baker University Today 
 Today, the University serves 3,000 students through the College of Arts and Sciences on the Baldwin City campus; the School of Professional and Graduate Studies in Overland Park, Lawrence, Lee's Summit, Topeka and Wichita; and the School of Nursing Stormont- Vail Health Care in Topeka [Baker University](https://www.bakeru.edu/about-baker-university/history-mission-vision/#support).

## Relation to the Santa Fe Trail

  The Santa Fe Trail entered Douglas County near its southeast corner, a few miles east of Black Jack, from where it took a northwesterly course through Palmyra and on to Willow Springs. Here it turned to the southwest, passing close to Globe and Baden of later days and into Osage county about three miles north of the southwest corner of Douglas County. Wagon ruts are still visible at several locations in Douglas County.  To the east, in Johnson County, the trail splits from the Oregon and California Trail near Gardner, Kansas.   Trail ruts can easily be seen at the Ivan L. Boyd Prairie Preserve which is adjacent to the Battle of Black Jack site, at Black Jack Park near Baldwin City, KS [Santa Fe Trail Association](https://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/douglasco/index.html). 
 
## Location

One-half mile to the northwest of Palmyra Well is the Santa Fe Trail Park. It contains a large granite Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) marker. The diagonal county road adjacent to the park follows the exact route of the trail to the northwest. The property was donated to Baker University in 1907 and was recently placed on the National Registry of Historic Sites. Beyond here, the route traveled through a place called “The Narrows,” a ridge that separated Wakarusa Creek on the north and the Marais des Cygnes River to the south.
