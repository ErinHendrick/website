The fort is a historical military institution constructed of stone that was built in Pawnee, Kansas in 1854. It was created for the purpose of patrolling the Santa Fe trail.

The fort consisted of 92 buildings used to house the generals and the regiments of solders. The fort served as the main force to uphold the law of the United States along the Santa Fe Trail in the Kansas territory. The Kansas territory at the time only had small law enforcement, like sheriffs, who had limited control over areas outside their town limits. Traveling outside towns and between towns was done with great risk.  The Santa Fe Trail was patrolled by the military and provided safer travel. Forts were lined throughout the Santa Fe Trail.  Fort Larned was one of these forts. Fort Larned provided protetcion by sending out military patrols consisting of at least 12 men. The military patrols went between Fort Larned and it's neighboring forts along the Santa Fe Trail. Civilians could choose to travel with the patrols for safer travel. The military patrol not only provided safe travel but also enforced the new law.

The forts construction had largely to do with the discovery of gold in California in 1848. The discovery of gold was due to the acquisition of land from the Treaty of Guadalupe. The Treaty of Guadalupe resulted from the American-Mexican War. The new acquired territory needed to incorporate the laws of the United States. The laws were incorporated by implementing a military solution that utilized a fort centered infrastructure to support and protect important resource hubs, such as, the Santa Fe Trail. One of these forts was Fort Larned. The increased traffic of gold seekers and gold transporters made the trails going west a prime target for raiders and
bandits. 

## Native affairs
The fort maintained its purpose of patrolling its portion of the Santa Fe Trail from 1861-1868. In 1869, it was granted the function of being the Bureau of Indian Affairs. This made the fort become a place where native people who signed the Fort Wise Treaty would go to get annuities. The treaty allowed the United States settlers to travel and use the native land in exchange for annuities granted by the United States government. The chiefs of the tribes who signed this treaty ended up causing unrest amongst their tribes and the fort. This unrest continued until the treaty was abolished and the native people where moved to reservations.

In the forts twilight years as a United States military institution, it provided protection for workers on the construction of the Santa Fe Railroad in 1872. The forts troops would patrol the areas under construction instead of the Santa Fe Trail. Once the railroad was completed, the fort began to loose its relevance. Goods and travelers where transported by train and no longer needed protection. The fort operated for an additional six years. It was abandoned in 1878. The property was then auctioned off as Army surplus in 1883.

## The fort today
The fort today is pretty much what it looked like at its prime.  Most of the original buildings remain intact. When the fort was auctioned off, the new owner decided to use the existing buildings as housing for ranch workers and equipment. Since the buildings were repurposed, they have survived the passing of time. The site has been renovated. It now serves as a museum that can be visited by the public. The fort also has scheduled reenactments of a working fort.
