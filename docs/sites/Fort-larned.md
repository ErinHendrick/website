 The fort is a military institution constructed of stone that was
built in Pawnee, Texas in 1854. It was created for the purpose of patrolling the Santa Fe trail.

 The fort consisted of 92 buildings used to house the generals
 and the regiments of solders. The fort served as the
 main force to uphold the law of the United States in the Kansas portion
  of the Santa Fe trail.
 The territory at the time only had small law enforcement,
 like sheriffs, who had limited control over areas outside their
 towns' limits. Travelers that would leave towns to travel the trail
 would take grate risks as soon as they left the town's boundaries.
Their best bet for safe travel would be to use the protection provided from
the forts on the trail. Fort Larned would distribute protection by sending patrols
 of at least 12 men from one fort to the next to escort civilians and enforce the new law.


## A Gold River
The forts construction had largely to do with the discovery
of Gold in California in 1848. The discovery was possible thanks to the acquisition of land
from the treaty of Guadalupe from the American Mexican war.
The new acquired territory needed to incorporate the new law
of the United States . This was Accomplished by implementing various military
forts to support and protect important resource hubs such as the Santa Fe trail,
one of these forts being Fort Larned. The increased traffic of gold seekers
and gold transporters made the trails going west a prime target for raiders and
bandits to try and gain a score from the travelers of the trail.

## Native affairs
The fort maintained its purpose of patrolling its portion of the Santa Fe trail
from 1861-1868, then it was granted the function of being the bureau of Indian
affairs. This made the fort become a place where native peoples who singed the
fort wise treaty would go to get annuities. The treaty allowed the U.S  settlers to travel and use the native land in exchange of annuities granted by the U.S government.  The chefs of the tribes who signed this treaty ended up causing unrest amongst their tribes and the fort. That continued until 1868 when the treaty was abolished and the native people where moved to reservations

In the forts twilight years as a U.S military institution it provided protection for workers on the construction of the Santa Fe rail road in 1872. The forts troops would patrol the areas under construction instead of the trail. Once the rail road was completed the fort began to lose its relevance as goods and travelers would begin to choose traveling by train over traveling the trail. Due to its purpose no longer being needed, the fort operated for an additional six years when it was abandoned in 1878. The property was then auctioned off as army surplus in 1883.

## The fort today
This fort has been one of the lucky historical sites as most of the origanal buildings remain intact. The patron that the site had been sold to decided to use the existing buildings as a housing for ranch workers and equipment which lead to a decent upkeep of the site, saving it from the fate of other historic forts today. The site has been renovated and now serves as a museum that can be visited by the public to see scheduled reenactments of the workings of the fort portrayed by volunteer actors.
