San Miguel del Vado in San Miguel County, New Mexico was founded in 1794 and would later become a very important rest stop and Pecos River crossing for the Santa Fe Trail.[^Jenks1] Located east of Santa Fe and Las Vegas, its most significant period was during the height of the Santa Fe Trail between 1821 and 1880. San Miguel del Vado was officially the political seat of San Miguel County until 1860  when it was bypassed by the construction of the Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad in Las Vegas, NM.

## Spanish Settlement
San Miguel del Vado was established by [Lorenzo Marquez](http://dev.newmexicohistory.org/filedetails.php?fileID=9998) of Santa Fe, and 51 other Spanish families.[^source2] This was thanks to the [land grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Miguel_del_Vado_Land_Grant) approved by the Spanish Governor of the territory in November of 1794. Building Spanish outposts in the area was promoted for the protection of settlers against Comanche raids.[^source2-1] The residence of the village, or _Vecinos_ were Spanish, Pecos Indians, converted Comanche, and Native American slaves called _Genizaro_.


## Pecos River crossing for the Santa Fe Trail
San Miguel del Vado was a popular stop for merchants and traders on the Santa Fe Trail. It was named after Saint Michael of the Ford. Ford or river crossing is _Vado_ or _Bado_ in Spanish. The Pecos River flows from northern New Mexico and empties into the Rio Grande in southwest Texas. The village of San Miguel del Vado was established southeast of the Pecos River because it was an ideal crossing point for the river.

## San Miguel del Vado as trading common
Merchants would stop here and repackage or combine their goods and reduce their loads to avoid taxes and fees once they reached Santa Fe. Some French and American merchants would conduct their business in the San Miguel commons; bypass Santa Fe completely on their way to Chihuahua to avoid Spanish and Mexican duties[^NRHP8]. This of course, was not a welcome practice to the Spanish and later Mexican government, but they had little power to persuade traders to do their taxes. Spanish presidio government stationed troops in San Miguel to stop smuggling and tax evasion by merchants on the Santa Fe Trail.[^NRHP81][^LOAsource2]

## Historic Plaza
San Miguel has many historic buildings that illustrate architecture from different periods.  San Miguel del Vado's Plaza is bisected by the Santa Fe Trail and the Pecos River, making it function as two plazas.[^NRHP7] Two historic buildings remain on the east side of the plaza, the Dance Hall and Zaguan house retain Spanish period characteristics including low windows and wood ceilings. West of the Plaza lies the foundation of the old San Miguel County courthouse and what may have been a hotel.[^NRHP71]
Southwest of the historic church, metal and ceramic artifacts can still be spotted littering the ground. This is evidence of the gathering and resting place of traders and travelers on the Santa Fe Trail.[^Jenks3]

## San Miguel del Vado Church
San Miguel del Vado Church is located on the west side of the plaza. The Church is one of the oldest remaining buildings in the Settlement; however, the church's architecture is a mix of Spanish colonial, Gothic windows and spires, wood and linoleum floors, and a bell added in 1821, and other modern amenities. Despite these different design influences, the internal structure of the church is the same as when it was built in 1805, and it still functions as the cultural center of the village.[^NRHP83]

## Mexican independence gives new life to the Santa Fe Trail
With Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821, the Southwest was open for trade across the region. American and Texan trade with Mexico was restricted because of taxes between the nations. The Santa Fe Trail was utilized by Spanish merchants moving goods between Santa Fe and Mexico City. Conflicts regarding trade along the Santa Fe Trail led to war between Mexico and the United States in 1846. _Additional sentence, to get a new line "Conflicts regarding trade along the Santa Fe Trail led to war between Mexico and the United States in 1846." This is a filler line. Gonnna need to be two sentenes. Don't forget to add this, otherwise the line will be broken. Don't forget to delete this line._

## Decline in the second half of the 19th century

As an agricultural and cattle dependent economy, the district was effected by industrialization in the region. The productivity and political center of San Miguel county was relocated to Las Vegas in 1860[^NRHP9]. With construction of the Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad, San Miguel began to see its young men and workers leaving for better economic opportunities in Las Vegas and Santa Fe, NM, or in southern Colorado. This continued into the second half of the 19th century as San Miguel del Vado was reduced by the [Supreme Court ruling of 1897](https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1160&context=law_facultyscholarship) when U.S. supreme court decided to shrink the San Miguel del Vado Land grant from 300,000 acres to 5,000 acres.[^Jenks2] This decision cut the village off from their abundant grazing, agricultural and timber resources.

## San Miguel del Vado today
Today, NM State Route 3 follows the same route the Santa Fe Trail did during its heyday. The village was bypassed by construction of the national highways. Because San Miguel del Vado is off the beaten path, it was able to maintain its identity as a prime example of a Spanish colonial and early Mexican settlement. This historic district has been saved as gem of Santa Fe Trail history.
