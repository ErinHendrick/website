San Miguel del Vado (San Miguel County, New Mexico) was founded in 1794 and would later become a very important rest stop and Pecos River crossing for the Santa Fe Trail.[^Jenks1] Located east of Santa Fe and Las Vegas, its most significant period was during the height of the Santa Fe Trail between 1821 and 1880. San Miguel del Vado was officially the political seat of San Miguel County until 1860 when it was bypassed by the construction of the Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad in Las Vegas, New Mexico.

## Spanish Settlement

San Miguel del Vado was established by [Lorenzo Marquez](http://dev.newmexicohistory.org/filedetails.php?fileID=9998) of Santa Fe, and fifty-one other Spanish families.[^source2] This was thanks to the [land grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Miguel_del_Vado_Land_Grant) approved by the Spanish Governor of the territory in November of 1794. Building Spanish outposts in the area were promoted to protect settlers against Comanche raids.[^source2-1] The residence of the village, or _Vecinos_ were Spanish, [Pecos Indians](https://www.nps.gov/peco/learn/historyculture/people-of-pecos.htm), converted [Comanche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comanche), and Native American slaves called [_gen√Æzaros_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen%C3%ADzaro).


## Pecos River Crossing for the Santa Fe Trail

San Miguel del Vado (in English, *Saint Michael of the Ford*) was a popular stop for merchants and traders on the Santa Fe Trail. The Pecos River flows from northern New Mexico and empties into the Rio Grande in southwestern Texas. The village of San Miguel del Vado was established southeast of the Pecos River because it was an ideal crossing point for the river.

## San Miguel del Vado as Trading Common

Merchants would stop here and repackage or combine their goods to reduce their loads, thus avoiding duties and other extra fees once they reached Santa Fe. Some French and American merchants would conduct their business in the San Miguel commons, bypassing Santa Fe completely on their way to Chihuahua and thereby avoiding taxes altogether.[^NRHP8] The Spanish government eventually stationed troops in San Miguel to stop smuggling and tax evasion by merchants on the Santa Fe Trail.[^NRHP81][^LOAsource2]

## Historic Plaza

San Miguel has many historic buildings from different architectural periods. The town's plaza is bisected by the Santa Fe Trail and the Pecos River, essentially creating two distinct plazas.[^NRHP7] The two oldest buildings on the east side of the plaza, the Dance Hall and Zaguan House, retain Spanish period characteristics including low windows and wood ceilings. West of the Plaza lies the foundation of the old San Miguel County courthouse and what may have been a hotel, remants of the town's more recent history.[^NRHP71]

## San Miguel del Vado Church

San Miguel del Vado's church is located on the west side of the plaza. The church is one of the oldest remaining buildings in the settlement, but its mixed styling--featuring Gothic windows and spires, wood and linoleum floors, and a bell added in 1821--speak to multiple layers of the town's history. Despite these different design influences, the internal structure of the church is the same as when it was built in 1805, and it still functions as the cultural center of the village.[^NRHP83]

Southwest of the historic church, metal and ceramic artifacts still litter the ground. These were likely left by Santa Fe Trail travelers that stopped to rest or trade in San Miguel del Vado.[^Jenks3]

## The Santa Fe Trail After Mexican Independence

The Santa Fe Trail was utilized by Spanish merchants moving goods between Santa Fe and Mexico City. Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821 which opened up trade across the Southwest. Trade was limited however, because of heavy taxation between newly-formed Mexico and the United States. As tensions rose between the nations, the Santa Fe Trail remained in use. The trail was used by U.S. General Stephen W. Kearny during the [seizure of Santa Fe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Santa_Fe) in August 1846. General Kearny took control of San Miguel del Vado before reaching Santa Fe. The [Mexican American War](https://home.nps.gov/safe/learn/historyculture/map-timeline-2.htm) ended in 1846 with the signing of the [Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Guadalupe_Hidalgo) and what would become New Mexico Territory became a part of the United States.

## Decline in the Second Half of the Nineteenth Century

As an agricultural economy dependent upon stock (mainly cattle), the district was affected by industrialization in the region. The economic and political center of San Miguel County shifted to Las Vegas in 1860.[^NRHP9] With construction of the Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad, San Miguel began to see its young men and workers leaving for better economic opportunities in Las Vegas, Santa Fe, or southern Colorado. This continued into the second half of the nineteenth century as San Miguel del Vado was reduced by the [Supreme Court ruling of 1897](https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1160&context=law_facultyscholarship) that shrunk the San Miguel del Vado Land grant from 300,000 acres to 5,000 acres.[^Jenks2] This decision cut the village off from their abundant rangeland, farmland, and timber.

## San Miguel del Vado Today

Today, NM State Route 3 follows the same route the Santa Fe Trail did during its heyday. The village was bypassed by construction of the national highways. Because San Miguel del Vado is off the beaten path, it was able to maintain its identity as a prime example of a Spanish colonial and early Mexican settlement. This district has been preserved as an integral part of the Santa Fe Trail's history.
