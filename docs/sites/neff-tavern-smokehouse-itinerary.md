The Neff Tavern Smokehouse was part of the Neff tavern complex, that offered shelter to travellers on the northern Santa Fe Trail close to Arrow Rock, Missouri in the late 18th century (NPS Form, 1963, p.1).  Throughout the history of the greater building as the Neff family residence, its inhabitants lived through many important stages of national American history: European immigration, westward migration and the Civil War. These events impacted the ongoing live and form of the tavern and its annex the smokehouse. 

## The tavern's setting
The tavern was set at one of the trailheads of the Santa Fe Trail in central Missouri (NPS Form, 1963, XX). This region was experiencing a very wealthy period, as the Santa Fe Trail traders and travellers brought Spanish silver and goods to the central US, which established tight trading and economic relations (J. Gregg, 1845: p. 19 and K. Gregg, 1933). Especially, when the founder, Isaac Neff (1798 – early 19th century) (NPS Form,1963: statement of significance p. 1) moved to the area, these trading relations were strengthened, as Missouri became a state and part of the United States and Mexico reached independency of Spain (O’Brien, 2013: p.22). Both trading partners were now in the position to sovereignly follow their own interests. Assumably, this let the number of travellers increase and made a tavern a place of high demand. Furthermore, as will be shown later, the tavern was located on a big land possession, that was crossed by the Santa Fe Trail (NPS Form, 1963, statement of significance p. 1). The tavern was therefore set right on the pulse of trade and travel on the trail, which most probably, regarding the many reformations, that were performed on the house in its early years (NPS Form, 1963, statement of significance p. 2), attracted many of the above mentioned travellers.

## Isaac's history

Isaac Neff was a descendent of German immigrants, who most probably came to the US in the beginning of the 18th century and settled in Tennessee (NPS Form, 1963: statement of significance p.1). According to the historical events (wars, revolutions, etc.), that were occurring during the 1700’s in Europe, the Neff family as many other German immigrants at the time were escaping violent conflicts in their home communities or had to leave because of industrialization and the consequent job losses (Parker, 2002: p. 6). This is especially important to have in mind, when looking at the further development in Isaac’s life as he was able to accumulate a big possession (NPS Form, 1963: statement of significance p. 1f.)
His brothers were the first ones to go to present day Missouri, which after known visits at his brother’s houses, led Isaac to finally settle in the Arrow Rock area in 1836 (NPS Form, 1963, statement of significance p. 1). As many migrants (Turner, 1894: p. 214), he was able to establish a big possession (on the peak 2.000 acres of land) right after his settlement and freely establish a profitable business (NPS Form, 1963, statement of significance p. 1f.). 


## The Neffs and the Civil War

 The Neff family incorporated many facets of American history, on one hand that is Isaac Neff going with westward migration movement and building up a new, successful living in Missouri. On the other hand, the following generation of the Neff family, most importantly, Isaac’s son Abram (1839 – 1924, see Weblink nr. 1), took part in yet another very important chapter of American history: The Civil War (NPS Form, 1963, statement of significance p. 2). Although, Missouri was very diverse in the distribution of Confederates and Unionists, the greater trend was rather conservative but anti-slavery based (Gerteis, 2012: p. IX). Nevertheless, Abram was fighting on the Confederate side (NPS Form, 1963: statement of significance p. 2) and although he owned the tavern, didn’t pursue a gastronomic career and finished his medical degree and practiced as a physician in the house of the former tavern (NPS Form, 1963: statement of significance p. 2). Everything, except for the smoke house was torn down by Abram in the 1890’s, in order to build a modern frame house on the land (NPS Form, 1963: statement of significance p. 2).
Therefore, the smokehouse is the only remaining part of the previous tavern, which served as a meeting point to the travellers that established a blossoming economy in Missouri, through their trade with Mexico. It is also a remain of a family residence, that incorporates many stages of American history, as is the European immigration, the west ward migration and the Civil War.
