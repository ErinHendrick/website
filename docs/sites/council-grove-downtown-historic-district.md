# Council Grove Downtown Historic District

Council Grove is situated an hour southwest of Topeka, Kansas on the Neosho River. Beginning as a trading post in 1847, it played an important role along the Santa Fe Trail as the last stop heading west until Santa Fe.[^Andreas] It served traders, merchants, and ranchers throughout the nineteenth century. When the Santa Fe Trail opened up in 1821, Council Grove was just an area with plenty of grazing land, water, trees, and safe crossing.[^NRHP-Brigham] By 1854, with the opening of Kansas to white settlers, Council Grove changed from a simple trading post to the true jumping-off point for the Santa Fe Trail.[^Brigham-Andreas] As time went on, Council Grove continued to expand and adapt to developments like the adoption of railroads and the subsequent cattle trade.[^Maloy]

When the Santa Fe Trail opened in 1821, Council Grove was little more than a rest stop.[^NRHP8441] The area boasted plenty of water, grazing land, trees, and safety.[^NRHP8442] While still organized as an Indian territory, [Seth Hays](https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/seth-millington-hays/17339)--a business man and the first white settler in Council Grove--opened the first trading post under government contract in 1847.[^Maloy2] By 1854 Seth Hays had competition from the Withington brothers, the Choteau brothers, and others.[^Brigham-Maloy] Seth Hays built the first house in Council Grove in 1857.[^Brigham12] With more people realizing the potential for business as the last stop heading west on the Santa Fe Trail, Tom Hill constructed the [Last Chance Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Chance_Store) the same year.[^Brigham15] The store provided the last supplies along the Santa Fe Trail for hundreds of miles. The organization of Kansas Territory in 1854 meant towns could begin incorporating; Seth Hays and other businesspeople formed Council Grove's town company in 1857, and the town incorporated in 1858.[^Brigham1116]

## Railroad or Bust
With the advent of the railroad, Council Grove's citizens looked to cash in on the extra potential for transportation and movement. In 1865 the town passed a $100,000 bond measure that ultimately failed to attract railroads.[^Maloy50] The town had to wait four more years for a railroad, and in 1869 the [M. K. & T. Railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri%E2%80%93Kansas%E2%80%93Texas_Railroad) first passed through the town.[^Brigham40] In 1881 more bonds passed to bring the Topeka, Salina and Southwestern Railroad, which eventually became part of the [Missouri Pacific Railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Pacific_Railroad) line.[^Brigham62] These railroad lines helped the town maintain its importance as a stop alogn the Santa Fe Trail.

## Twentieth Century to Post War Era
Looking to connect more farmers, ranchers, and businesses to more people, Council Grove began to develop a road system for automobiles in the early 20th century.[^NRHP8501] By 1913 there were over 200 automobiles in Council Grove and by 1921 there were 47 miles of hard surface roads to be built in the town.[^NRHP850-Brigham98] While Kansas began implementing plans on a unified road network, Council Grove was able to bring three highways through the town by 1932.

The 1920s-30s proved to be a difficult time for Council Grove. In the early part of the 1920s, many farmers went into debt due to inflated crop prices.[^NRHP8521] However, with large federal investment during the [New Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal) of the 1930s, Council Grove was able to overcome difficulties and create a safer and modern town. The [Works Progress Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration) approved $40 million in 1934 to help prevent flooding; the project was completed in 1942.[^NRHP8522] The town received other New Deal-era help from the federal government including a new jail, a post office, a water plant, and the Flint Hills Rural Electrification Administration.[^NRHP8553]

After World War II, the Kansas State Legislature approved money to buy the [Kaw Indian Mission](https://www.kshs.org/index.php?url=kaw_mission) to create a museum as part of an effort to increase tourism.[^NRHP8531] Nature, however, had other plans. While Council Grove had experienced many floods before, the 1951 flood was unlike any other. With the Neosho Rover flowing at 121,000 cubic feet/second, many buildings downtown were damaged.[^Juracek4] The Kaw Indian Mission was damanged badly enough to delay its opening for another year.[^NRHP8532] This new museum, in addition to a new reservoir, began bringing several thousand people a year to Council Grove.[^NRHP8533]
