# Lanesfield School

### A one-room schoolhouse was established in 1869 in the town of Lanesfield, Kansas
The Lanesfield School was a one-room schoolhouse that was in use from 1869 to 1963 and is considered the last standing building from the mail stop town of Lanesfield, Kansas, near modern day Edgerton, Kansas. The town was founded by James Lane in 1858 (NRF) and he began construction of the town very quickly. Lane managed the construction of a hotel, three stores, a blacksmith shop, three churches, residential houses and a one-room schoolhouse. Lanesfield served as a rest stop for travelers along the Santa Fe Trail and as a mail stop which was even along the route of the Pony Express. Students from the school noted that they could see travelers on the trail from their schoolhouse window (Feldman 83). The developement of a railroad station in 1870 in the nearby town of Edgerton diminished Lanesfield's population as many people moved closer to the train station. Many buildings were left unused but the schoolhouse remained an important part of Lanesfield as it served all the children in the area.

### The one-room schoolhouse played a central role in rural American communities and faced the challenges of educating many children with few supplies
The one-room schoolhouse was an institution that had its heyday in America during the late 19th and early 20th centuries and played a large role in rural communities. These schools were often the lifeblood and central building of small rural towns and were directed by local entities which meant that education varied greatly from one school to the next. Supplies were often limited and students and teachers had to make do with what they had. At one time a schoolteacher would be responsible for teaching eight different grades in one small room, many children missing multiple lessons to help out at their homes (Jenner). The Lanesfield School also suffered from many of the same issues that other one-room schoolhouses faced. In 1870 the school had 69 students enrolled ages 5 to 20 but only had an average attendance of 51. In 1897, the county superintendent stated that the schoolhouse was in disrepair which sparked a major cleanup effort by the town (NRF). Despite difficulties, the school played an essential role in the community. In addition to being a school, the building also served as a community meeting place, pollint station, a venue for school reunions, and a meeting place for many community groups (NRF).

### The school was struck by lightning in 1903
In a dramatic turn of events, the school building burned down in 1903 due to a strike of lightning. Only the stone foundation of the building was left intact. The town of Lanesfield suffered because of the building's destruction and quickly underwent reconstruction efforts and it was largely in use again by 1904. (NRF)

### One-room schoolhouses began to be shut down in the 1940s and 1950s
Following an increasingly frequent trend of one-room schoolhouses being consolidated in rural areas, the Lanesfield School was combined with Round Oak and Splinterville School in 1950 (NRF). In the 1940s and 1950s many Kansas rural schools were closing their doors. Less and less children were enrolling and it made more financial sense to send children to larger schools with better managed facilities. A major loss of students was also caused by families moving away from rural towns into larger cities(Closing Kansas Rural Schools in 1940s, gov. doc). Lanesfield School fell to the same fate as the town of Lanesfield began to decline in the late 1950s and early 1960s and the school eventual closed its doors in 1963 after being in use for 93 years (NRF).

### Lanesfield School is now a public museum
The school was turned into a museum in 1967 and it is still open to the public today. Visitors can visit the school and experience writing on slates, cleaning the blackboard, and what general life in a one-room schoolhouse was like during the late 19th and early 20th centuries along the Santa Fe Trail.
