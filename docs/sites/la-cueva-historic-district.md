Just a short drive from Ft. Union Natioanl Monument, across the northern plains of New Mexico and nearing the foothils of Santa Fe National Forest, you will find the La Cueva Historic District. La Cueva Historic District is located at the intersection of NM442 and NM518, 33.1 miles northwest of Ft.Union National Monument. La Cueva Historic District had a historically significant time period from around 1851 to 1946 and helped shape the Ft. Union region and had direct impacts to the Santa Fe Trail.  The site consists of several structures: the Romero Hacienda, a Grist Mill, a mercantile building, the Church of San Rafel, stables, a farm, aquecia, and a few outbuildings.  

## Founding La Cueva

La Cueva was founded by Vicente Romero around 1851.  Previous to Vicente Romero, the land was a Spanish land grant, and Romero purchased a 33,000 acre portion of the original Mora land grant from several descendants who owned the property (NPS form p.3 ).  The name "La Cueva" (translation: The Cave) may have come from a few origins for the site:  Vicente had been a sheep herder, and legend has it that he utilized caves in the area to seek shelter when needed.  This earned him the title of 'La Cueva' to which his property was then named.  Others say the ranch was named La Cueva simply due to a nearby cave (Ranchos of Northern New Mexico p. 19).  The official reason for the naming convention may never be known.  One thing was for certain, Vicente realized the potential of the land and the nearby Mora River for agriculture.     


## Milling, Farming, and the Santa Fe Trail



While LCHD is located miles from the Santa Fe trail, it's importance to shaping the region went hand in hand with Ft.Union.  Vicinte Romero would  divert a portion of the streamflow of the  Mora River into a network of irrigation ditches called "acequias" that would power an on-site grist mill: The La Cueva Mill (NPS form p.3).  In the 1850's electricity had not yet come to the masses and it was common for hydro power to be used to enable grain mills. (XXXXX) In addition to powereing the mill wheel, the acequia would also provide irrigation to the Romero Farm (Water for the southwest p. 90).  Regional mills were important along trails during the 1800's before rail travel was possible (XXXXX).  Mills provided processed grain to stops along the trails.  In La Cueva, the Grist Mill provided milled flour and wheat to Ft. Union.  As many as 60 horse or oxen drawn to Ft.Union each day (Ranchos of Northern NM p.19).  The close proximity of the farmland and mill made this a lucrative farm for the Romero family.  (XXXXXX)

The Romero's also called the property home. Dubbed "The Romero Hacienda", the house would also serve as a community center for the region (NPS form p.4).  While the specific groups that met here have been obscured by passing time, we do know that ranchers and travelers in the region would stop at the house to meet.  The Hacienda was attached to a mercantile store and a large stable where travelers could stay for the night, buy supplies, and rest their horses (NPS form p.4). (XXXXXX)

## A Mission Arrives
Vicente also commissioned a church to be built on the property that would become known as the San Rafeal Mission Church (NPS form p.4).  The church was started in 1862 and finished in 1870.   Preists from the Lamy, NM area came to help build the mission.  Of note, the mission featured ornate gothic stylings and Belgian rafter system; both rare in the area during the 1800's. (XXXXXX)
