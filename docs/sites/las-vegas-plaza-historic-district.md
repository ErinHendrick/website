Scenic Las Vegas New Mexico is place founded with strong historic roots in the Santa Fe Trail. The Plaza that acts as a centerpiece for the town represents a continued dedication to the town’s important origins even in the present. Las Vegas was founded in 1838 as a land grant approved by Governor Francisco Sarracino. Las Vegas began as part of the growing effort to expand Mexican settlements along the Santa Fe Trail; it quickly became an essential stop for the extraordinary pioneers, explorers, and traders. But, As result of the Spanish American war the New Mexico was annexed by the United States thus trading ownership of the land to the Americans. Las Vegas remained an important stop along the Santa Fe Trail allowing it to remain economically resilient as unique encapsulation of the western ethos. 

 What originally began as a land granted for an assortment to families in the North New Mexican region name the *“Vegas Grandes”* (The Great Meadows). Nestled at the base of the Pecos Mountains and the vast plains the Las Vegas settlement began as fledging town with its citizens huddled within its walls that marked the boundaries of the “plaza” Soon the town was gained traction had begun to build permanent homes and buildings of adobe bricks. The plaza became the first completed goal of the settlement and to this day has traditionally marked the center of the historic town
 
## Changing Times ##

By August 15, 1846 the town had undergone several modifications and had been significantly built up from its fledgling past. Citizens had begun to grow the town adding many more buildings extending from the plaza. The population of Las Vegas had gone through a small boom somewhere between 200/300 people living in the village. Despite its growing size, Las Vegas was still reliant on the Adobe Bricks to make housing. Its during this time that members of the American army had begun to circulate through the town taking note of unremarkable yet functioning it was.

Between its founding and the beginning of the Civil War, Las Vegas thrived as frontier town operating on the Santa Fe Trail. Records pop up from travelers along the trail documenting the increasing stability and buildup of the town. Most notes show a thriving yet architecturally simple town operating with irrigation canals running throughout the streets, and still be comprised mostly of adobe buildings. What is Fascinating however, is that the citizens had begun to build the plaza up taking up Victorian style architecture in its city center. Most of these buildings underwent various changes but the most notable of the plaza structures was the three-story plaza hotel that appeared as a cornerstone gem to the town. The Plaza Hotel (which still operates proudly to this day) was among the various Victorian style buildings that made up the plaza. 

## Spirit of the West ##

When waves of the civil war reached, New Mexico Las Vegas became the operational headquarters of the union forces from the within the Plaza Hotel following the loss of Fort Sumner. Allowing for a safe a triumphant place to conduct the battle affairs union forces marched out from Las Vegas to defeat the Confederates at [the battle of Glorietta Pass](https://www.nps.gov/peco/learn/historyculture/copy-of-battleofglorietta.htm). 
Until the arrival of the railroad Las Vegas remained at steady growth from the travelers along the Santa Fe trail , hotels including the Plaza Hotel itself thrived from continued tourism and business, colleges were established, and Las Vegas became synonymous with the western lifestyle. Because of the rough untamed attitude nature of western culture as a whole and Las Vegas’ generally notorious fame along the trail, attracted many lawless gangs of bandits and outlaws through the dusty streets. Many of the gangs choose to operate from within local taverns. Despite the perception of lawlessness, the town continued to thrive until the railroad arrive. 

## Railroads and Las Vegas Today ##

Las Vegas was one of first towns to receive significant access to booming rail industry. However, the Plaza was located west of Gaillenas River that had formed one of the natural boarders in the town center making it difficult to lay tracks near the plaza. So train station was established in the new East Las Vegas forming a heated rivalry between two towns. Commerce diverted from West Las Vegas, which held the plaza, and led to noticeable decline to the livelihood of the Western town. The dramatic booming tourist industry declined steadily and the Western ethos began fading slowly bringing about a much more Americanized civilization imported from the East. East and West Las Vegas were eventually combined into one singular town during the 1970’s but still faces decline to depressed economy rooted only in tourism and Highlands University. Las Vegas is still considerably large with a stabile population and an impressive amount of historical tourism present mostly centered on its history as a frontier town, outlaw mysticism, and railroad legacy. The town is currently intent on preserving its physical historical legacy through its buildings and infrastructure of the plaza.
