# Santa Fe Trail Historic Sites

### "At last all are fairly launched upon the broad prairie--the miseries of preparation are over--the thousand anxities occasioned by wearisome consultations and delays are felt no more. The charioteer, as he smacks his whip, feels a bounding elasticity of soul within him, which he finds it impossible to restrain.... The hilarious song, the _bon mot_ and the witty repartee, go round in quick succession; and before people had had leisure to take cognizance of the fact, the lively village of Independence...is already lost to the eye." -Josiah Gregg, _Commerce of the Prairies_, 26

The Santa Fe Trail offers much more than a simple story of America's westward expansion. Pioneered in 1821 by William Becknell, it served as a vital commercial highway until the introduction of the railroad to Santa Fe in 1880. The trail connected Missouri, on the western margin of a growing United States, with New Mexico, at the northern end of a newly-independent, Spanish-speaking nation; Santa Fe was near the end of the El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, which carried trade from Mexico City. This massive system of exchange linked different continents, commodities, and cultural groups across vast distances.

Today, the National Park Service recognizes a variety of trail sites--ruts, crossings, houses, forts--integral in telling the trail's story. While some of these are more easily accessed than others, cultural resources along the Santa Fe Trail remind us that highways existed long before the automobile. Accordingly, the Santa Fe Trail National Scenic Byway follows the general contours of the trail through Kansas, southern Colorado, and northern New Mexico.
