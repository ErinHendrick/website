# Baker University Old Castle Building 
## History 
In 1858, Baker University was founded by what was then the Methodist Episcopal Church on the Santa Fe Trail in the middle of the area that was to become known as "Bleeding Kansas."(HCAP) The doors of Old Castle Hall were opened for students November 22, 1858, making it the oldest college in the State of Kansas. 

*The oldest four-year college in Kansas has a rich history, growing up side-by-side with the state of Kansas, Castle Hall was the first building ever erected on campus. It has survived major events such as, the Civil War, drought, floods, tornadoes, and even grasshoppers to become one of the premier colleges in the country. HCAP

### Significance 
 * The Baker University campus is significant because of its history, tradition, and people, it is the oldest liberal arts college in Kansas.
 * Baker Unversity is unique as it admitted women early on in its history, the first graduating class in 1866 contained one women, and two men. 
 * President Abraham Lincoln gave $100 to help build Parmenter Hall, the only donation he ever gave to any university. 
 
## Construction 
* It was erected off campus because school trustees lacked sufficient funds to build the type of permanent structure they desired and they did not want to erect a temporary structure on the campus. College officials could raise only enough funds to construct two stories of the planned three-story structure. The Palmyra Masonic lodge financed the third floor in exchange for regular use of a room for lodge meetings.

* Old Castle Hall, a crudely quoined three-story rubble-stone building, originally consisted of only two stories. The third story was added later and then afterward torn off because of poor mortar joints; it was then added for a second time and remains to date.

## Building Uses Through the Years
 * After another building was completed in 1871, the Old Castle Hall was no longer used for classes. In 1874 the president of the college, Joseph Denison, used it as his home. Other uses over the years have been mill, student rooming house, public school, and storage place for athletic materials and other college property.
