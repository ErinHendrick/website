<ul>
  <li>Name comes from a flour and grist mill built near the Little Blue River. (NPS form)</li>
  <li>http://www.santafetrailresearch.com/mileagecharts/sft-missouri.html says there was a gristmill and sawmill.</li>
  <li>Santa Fe Trail ran between the mills</li>
  <li>Mills played an important role in providing provisions to travelers.</li>
  <li>Often served as a locus for settlement and provided valuable goods and services to Trail travelers and area residents,</li>
  <li>existing mills represent a tangible reminder of Santa Fe Trail traffic from 1834 to 1865.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Mills provided advantage to businessmen by eliminating need to purchase flour from the East to resell in their stores.</li>
  <li>The mills could provide both flour and lumber, and possibly meat.

<h2 id="original-impetus-for-the-mills-derived-from-the-prospect-of-securing-contracts-with-fort-leavenworth">Original impetus for the mills derived from the prospect of securing contracts with Fort Leavenworth.</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In 1834, the Aull firm was defeated in its bid to provide the fort with staple supplies, such as flour.</li>
  <li>To ensure that the next year’s bid was the lowest, James constructed the gristmill at the Little Blue River, which would enable him to grind his own flour and reduce costs.</li>
  <li>His bid was the lowest and he secured the $6,500 contract from the US gov’t. (fn 16)</li>

  <li>As flour and lumber were particularly important frontier necessities</li>
  <li>Flour from the gristmill was shipped to Independence, St. Joseph, and Fort Leavenworth (the owners 14</li>
  <li>settlement was precursor to Independence as recognized terminus of trail, but still important because of its proximity. (Hickman, 92)</li>

<h2 id="the-blue-mills-area-was-well-known-for-several-crossings-of-the-missouri-river">The Blue Mills area was well known for several crossings of the Missouri River.</h2>
<ul>
  <li>main area crossing was Fort Osage</li>
  <li>Started as Owens landing in 1829 (what is best source?)</li>
  <li>continued into the 1860s</li>
  <li>“countless tons of trade goods bound for Santa Fe went up to Independence from this landing.” (fn 21–find primary source)</li>
  <li>As steamboat use moved the eastern terminus of the Trail farther westward to the new town of Independence, Blue Mills Landing took on a lead role as the transition point between water transport and land transport.</li>
  <li>Blue Mills Landing was also the transfer point for emigrants heading westward.
