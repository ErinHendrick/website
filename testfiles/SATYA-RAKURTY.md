## [Farewell](https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/farewell-2/)

I have got my leave. **Bid me farewell, my brothers!**

_I bow to you all and take my departure_


> Here I give back the keys of my door
....and I give up all claims to my house.
I only ask for last kind words from you.


1. We were neighbors for long,

   but I received more than I could give.

2. Now the day has dawned

   and the lamp that lit my dark corner is out.

_A summons has come and I am ready for my journey_.
