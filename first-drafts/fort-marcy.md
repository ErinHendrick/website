On August 19, 1846, New Mexico was annexed and Mexican Govener, Juan Bautista Vigil y Alarid peaceful surrendered New Mexico to the United Staes. Soon after, United States General, Stephen W. Kearny was sent to occupie Santa Fe and ordered the construction of Fort Macry on August 26, 1846. General Kearny named the Fort after the U.S. Secretary of War, William L. Marcy. Lieutenant William H. Emory and Jeremy F. Gilmer, the subordinates of General Kearly, determained that the best place for the fort to be built was ontop of a larg hill that over looked Santa Fe and that was just 600 yards north from the Santa Fe Plaza.

This was Ideal for General Kearly as he needed to both secure the U.S. possession of New Mexico and to guard against an uprising from the people. Lieutenant William H. Emory stating that the possition on top of the hill was "the only point which commands the entire town and which itself is comanded by no other". This position was a commanding one as it was previously used by Native Americans when raiders and would soon become a irregular star shaped, adobie walled fort.

Fort Marcy  would later play its role in guarding against any uprising as in, January 19, 1847, Colonel Sterling Price, the commander of fort Marcy at the time would recive word that  Charles Bent, Governor of New Mexico had been killed in the Taos Revolt. Colonel Price would then sent troops from fort Marcy to quell the rebelion and was sucsessful in doing so.

Fort Marcy like many of the other of the fortifications in area were there in part to protect commerce and travel on the Santa Fe and the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro trail, from Native American raids. Fort Craig being just south of Socorro was the “base for Indian operations” and served this exact purpose during the later end of the 19th century, sending out armed esscarts with traders going along the the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro trail. Fort Marcy serving as a combat post at the cross section of the Santa Fe and the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro trail, in July 1854, would conduct the surrender of the Jicarilla Apaches.
