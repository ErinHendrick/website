# San Miguel del Vado Historic District
### Spanish Settlement
San Miguel was founded in 1794 and would later become a very important rest stop on the Santa Fe Trail. It was established by Lorenzo Marquez of Santa Fe, and 51 other Spanish families, thanks to the land grant approved by Governor Chacon in November of 1794. Building Spanish outposts in the area was promoted for the protection of settlers against Comanche raids. The residence of the village, or _Vecinos_ were Spanish, Pecos Indians, converted Comanche and Native American slaves called _Genizaro_. Its most sinificant period was during the height of the Santa Fe trail between 1821 and 1880. San Miguel was officially the political seat of San Miguel County until 1860 when it was bypassed by the construction of the AT&SF railroad in Las Vegas, NM.
> The original San Miguel del Vado Grant described the location as north of the Pecos River, "from the place called Rancheria to Agua Caliente, on the south the Canon Blanco, to the east the Cuesta, with the little hills of Bernal, and on the west the place commonly called the Guzano."

### Pecos River crossing for the Santa Fe Trail
San Miguel was a popular stop on the Santa Fe Trail. It was named after Saint Miguel of the Ford, _Vado_ or _Bado_ or river crossing in Spanish. Established southeast of the Pecos River, by an ideal crossing point. Merchants would stop here and repackage or combine their goods to reduce their loads and avoid taxes and fees once they reached Santa Fe. Some American merchants would conduct their business in the San Miguel commons; bypass Santa Fe completely on their way to Chihuahua to avoid Spanish and Mexican duties. This of course, was not a welcome practice to the Mexican government, but they had little power to persuade traders to do their taxes.

### Historic plaza
Unlike most plazas from the Spanish period, San Miguel del Vado's is bisected by the Santa Fe Trail and the Pecos River, making it function as two bisected plazas. To the east, the Pecos River runs north to southeast. Two historic buildings also remain on the east side of the plaza, the Dance Hall and Zaguan house retain period characteristics including low windows and wood ceilings. San Miguel del Vado Church is on the west side of the plaza. The Church is one of the oldest remaining buildings in the Settlement; however, the church's architecture is a mix of Spanish colonial, gothic windows, spires, wood and linoleum floors, and a bell added in 1821, and other modern amenities. Despite these different design influences, the internal structure of the church is the same as when it was built in 1805, and it still functions as the cultural center of the village.

Southwest of the historic church, metal and ceramic artifacts can still be spotted littering the ground. This is evidence of the gathering and resting place of traders and travelers on the Santa Fe Trail.

### Mexican independence gives new life to the Santa Fe Trail

With Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821, the Southwest was open for trade across the region. The Santa Fe Trail was utilized by Spanish merchants moving goods between Santa Fe and Mexico City. In 1841, an expedition of Texans was captured on their way to Santa Fe for trying to annex the trading hub for the Republic of Texas. American and Texan trade with Mexico was restricted because of taxes between the nations. The Texan-Santa Fe expedition was captured and imprisoned in San Miguel for a period before being transported into Mexico City.

### New Mexico becomes part of the United States
The Mexican American War began with U.S. President Polk declaring war with Mexico in April of 1846. General Kearny captured San Miguel on his way to invading Santa Fe in August of 1846.

### Decline in the second half of the 19th century

After the completion of the AT&SF Railroad in 1880, San Miguel began to see its young men and workers leaving for better economic opportunities in Las Vegas, Santa Fe and Colorado. The productivity and political center of the county was relocated to Las Vegas in 1860. This continued into the second half of the 19th century as San Miguel del Vado was reduced by the Supreme Court ruling of 1897. The U.S. supreme courty decided to shrink the San Miguel del Vado Land grant from 300,000 acres to 5,000 acres. This decision cut the _vecinos_ from their abundant grazing, agricultural and timber resources.

### San Miguel del Vado today
This area was not able to keep up with development surrounding it during the 20th century. It was bypassed when the national highways were built, today state route 3 follows the same path the Santa Fe Trail did during its heyday. Because San Miguel del Vado was overlooked, it was able to maintain its identity as a prime example of a Spanish colonial and early Mexican settlement.
