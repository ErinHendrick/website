## History 

Baker University first opened its doors to students in November 1858, in Baldwin City, Kansas. Named for Osmon Cleander Baker, a distinguished scholar and bishop of what is now the United Methodist Church, the school holds the honor of being the first university in Kansas (KHS).

* The university has a rich history, growing up side-by-side with the state of Kansas, Castle Hall was the first building ever erected on campus. 

* It has survived major events such as, the Civil War, drought, floods, tornadoes, and even grasshoppers to become one of the premier colleges in the country. HCAP 

* Baker University struggled through its first years due to a drought in 1860 and the Civil War, and the first class graduated in 1866.

## Construction 
* It was erected off campus because school trustees lacked sufficient funds to build the type of permanent structure they desired and they did not want to erect a temporary structure on the campus. College officials could raise only enough funds to construct two stories of the planned three-story structure. The Palmyra Masonic lodge financed the third floor in exchange for regular use of a room for lodge meetings. (HCAP)

* Old Castle Hall, a crudely quoined three-story rubble-stone building, originally consisted of only two stories. The third story was added later and then afterward torn off because of poor mortar joints; it was then added for a second time and remains to date.(NRHP)

## Building uses Through the Years
 * After another building was completed in 1871, the Old Castle Hall was no longer used for classes. In 1874 the president of the college, Joseph Denison, used it as his home. Other uses over the years have been mill, student rooming house, public school, and storage place for athletic materials and other college property. (HCAP)
