## **Early Significance**

# **William Becknell**
His description scared people away (Becknell) Instead, most traders hauling heavily laden wagons along the Santa Fé Trail took what was known as the Cimarron Cutoff, which cut diagonally across southwest Kansas and northeast New Mexico to avoid the mountains. Raton Pass, on the other hand, was on the Mountain Branch of the trail, which was longer and more difficult but did have the advantages of more water and less exposure to Indian attacks. It received far less traffic than the Cimarron Cutoff but was used by traders who went up the Arkansas River to Bent’s Fort and then turned south toward Santa Fé, especially those traveling with only a few pack animals or light wagons.

## **His Past**
In 1820, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Missouri House of Representatives. (legends of america) One of the first beaver trappers in New Mexico (Weber, 254.)
## **His Journeys**
The next year, he organized a trading party that crossed the Great Plains to New Mexico. He left Franklin, Missouri with four companions in September, 1821 on his first trip to the western US with a load of freight to deliver to Santa Fe. He traveled via the Mountain Branch of the Santa Fe Trail. (Weber 24)
 Santa Fe (November 16, 1821)  Becknell sold the goods at a high profit. After a month of trading, Becknell and his party left Santa Fe on December 13th. His investment of $300 in trading goods had returned approximately $6000 in coin. The men returned to Missouri safely in January, 1822.
## **His Legacy**
spent two days moving rocks so the horses could get through 7,834-foot-high Raton Pass, where Indians, Conquistadors, trappers, and traders had already established a rough trail. However, that portion of the journey has been called into question after the discovery of the diary of Pedro Ignacio Gallego in 1993. Mexican Captain Gallego and his 400 men met Becknell on his first journey to Santa Fe, and his writings, along with Becknell’s own journal describing the landscape, show more evidence that he and his men probably mis-identified the Canadian River, and instead crossed another river or stream. evidence points to a location between the Arkansas River and Puertocito Piedra Lumbre in Kearny Gap, south of present day Las Vegas, New Mexico.

The profits made by William Becknell’s first trading trip brought much needed money and valuable goods into central Missouri where the Panic of 1819 had a devastating effect on the economy. The influx of Mexican coins significantly helped Missouri’s economy as farmers and local merchants found a new market for their goods. 

# **Wootton**

# **Wagon and Railroad Route**
1866 Wootton completed road, making Raton Pass a relatively easy journey for stagecoaches, freight wagons, tourists, and other travelers. Wootton built his house and toll gate on the Colorado side of the pass, collecting $1.50 per wagon. RESEARCH WOOTONS HOUSE
Daily stage service on the route started soon after gold was discovered in New Mexico’s Moreno Valley in 1867. RESEARCH

1878, the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad (ATSF) beat the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad (D&RG) to the route up Raton Pass, which had space for only one rail line. ATSF decided to tunnel under the summit of the pass to cut down on what was already a steep and grueling climb, but in the meantime it built a temporary track over the pass to allow trains to start traveling the route in late 1878. This marked the end of most wagon and stagecoach traffic over Raton Pass. The railroad tunnel under the pass opened in September 1879.

# **Military**
Two nineteenth-century military crossings are especially notable in the history of Raton Pass. The first came in August 1846, during the Mexican-American War, when Stephen Kearny’s Army of the West used the pass to invade New Mexico. Kearny chose Raton Pass for two reasons: first, he could use Bent’s Fort as a base, and second, it had more water than the Cimarron Cutoff, an especially important advantage in the summer. Kearny left Bent’s Fort on August 2, sending road crews in advance to try to improve the route for the advancing army. Nevertheless, the army still had difficulty getting over the pass and lost many wagons descending into New Mexico, which Kearny’s army quickly claimed for the US.

Raton Pass played an important military role again during the Civil War. Because the Cimarron Cutoff was more exposed to Confederate and Indian attacks, the Union used Raton Pass to supply troops stationed in New Mexico. In 1862, when Confederate troops were advancing north through New Mexico, a regiment of Colorado Volunteers marched over Raton Pass to reinforce Union troops and win a major victory at the Battle of Glorieta Pass.

# **Modernity**

In 1908 ATSF completed a second tunnel under Raton Pass to handle increased traffic, but two other developments the same year signaled the decline of Raton Pass as a major rail corridor. First, ATSF finished the Belen Cutoff in central New Mexico, giving the railroad a southern transcontinental route that avoided the steep grades of Raton Pass. Raton Pass continued to be used for passengers and local freight, but all long-haul freight now took the Belen Cutoff route. The original 1879 tunnel under Raton Pass was closed in 1953, but the 1908 tunnel is still in service for the single Amtrak passenger train that uses Raton Pass on its route between Chicago and Los Angeles.

In 1908–9 New Mexico used convict labor to build a new highway that crossed the Colorado border near Raton Pass. (CO Encyclopedia)

In 1926 the highway over Raton Pass was designated as US 85 and improved over the next few years. In 1942 it was realigned to the old Wootton route along the Santa Fé Trail, which was less steep and involved fewer tight curves. This route was incorporated into Interstate 25 in the early 1960s. The interstate runs slightly east of Raton Pass and the railroad tunnels under the pass, leaving the summit as the best place to see surviving remnants of earlier routes.

Despite being on the less popular Mountain Branch of the Santa Fé Trail, the pass has often been seen as a symbol of the trail’s hardships and of the boundary between Anglo and Hispanic cultures. Still an important corridor traversed by a railroad and Interstate 25, the pass was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1961.(Colorado Encyclopedia)
