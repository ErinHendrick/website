# St. Vrain's Mill
- Created in Mora, New Mexico, the St. Vrain's mill was used to fill the high-demand of flour by the US government during the Civil-War and to feed thousands of Navajo Indians during the period of the 'Long Walk'. A number of revolts in Taos, NM, saw a few of the Mills that St. Vrain owned be burned to the ground. This mill, though, in its entirety was rushed and crudely made, it again served a valuable function to not only the area but to others as well.  It is currently still standing in Mora, Nm, and is being persevered by the ‘St. Vrain Mill Preservation and Historical Foundation’, also located in Mora, Nm.

## Ceran St. Vrain
- Ceran St. Vrain was Frenchmen whose parents fled the French Revolution to French Territory in North America
- He made his early adulthood wages by selling fur. 
- He led a volunteer militia to crush a rebellion of Mexicans and Pueblo Indians. 
- Town builder (Locate other towns)
- Contracted by US govt to give the Navajos flour
- Started the Santa Fe Gazzete 
- During the start of the civil war he was given the rank of Colonel, though he didn't stay active along and eventually handed command


## Ceran St. Vrain's Stone Mill Was constructed to resist fire which had destroyed another of his mills' in Taos in the same year.
- The mill was created using stone blocks, which still stands without the need of modern repairs. 
- A number of Ceran St. Vrains Mills in Taos were burned down, so this mill was constructed to resist fire, 
  as far as the foundation goes. The building and overall aesthetic other than the foundation has seen better times. 

## The mill was located in Mora county
- The Mill is no longer located in a town; the location is approximately 1500 feet north of the junction state roads 3 and 30 in Mora
- County: Mora
    - Northern, New Mexico
## Mill was built in or around 1864
 - Mill was used to supply neighboring areas as well as for the feeding of the Navajos that were being held in and around Fort Sumner, NM, then known as Sunnyside.   
 - Flour was in high demand at this time which is one of the suspected reasons to why this mill was constructed. 
 - It is speculated that this mill was created to make up for the mill lost because of fire in Taos, NM. 

## The Mill is described as being crudely made
- One reason for the term crudely made is the fact for the time the mill using blocks of different size and different adhesive such as what was around, dirt, rocks, etc. The mill again was built in a hurry to meet demand but to also replace mills lost in Taos, NM. This meant that even the water-wheel, that is no longer attached to the building, was also rushed and crude in making. 

## (More about the esthetic of the mill)
- The mill from ground to roof is 43 feet high. The building had a total of three floor. Each block wall is supported by stone
  foundation. 
  Currently this mill is in awful shape due to the lack of up-keep. Whole areas are in need of repair, which is 
  laid out in the letter to Mr. Ken Earl from R. Gordon McKeen, P.E. of McKeen Consulting Engineers, LLC.  

## Closer of the Mill and Decline of area.
- Research closing of the mill
- Research the decline of the area, the town, and what became of the area through the years
- Current status
(Still researching)

### Other mill sites:
- Research how close the other sites (mills and towns) where to this mill. Maybe in order to put into perspective to why he was chosen to feed the Navajos.
