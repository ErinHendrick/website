# St. Vrain's Mill
 Created in or around 1864, the St. Vrain's mill, located in Mora, New Mexico, and was used to fill the high-demand of flour by the US government during the tail end of the Civil-War and to feed thousands of Navajo Indians during the period of the 'Long Walk'. A number of revolts in Taos, NM, saw a number of the mills that were owned by Ceran St. Vrain be burned to the ground. This mill, though, rushed and crudely made, served a valuable function to not only the area but to other valuable areas as well, such as military forts and holding encampments.  It is currently still standing in Mora, NM, and is being persevered by the ‘St. Vrain Mill Preservation and Historical Foundation’, also located in Mora, NM. The Mill is located approximately 1500 feet north of the junction state roads 3 and 30 in Mora, NM. 

## *Ceran St. Vrain's Stone Mill: Fire Resistant*
 The mill was created in a rush to meet high-demand and to replace what was lost in, Taos. The overall main goal was to fire proof the mill. This was accomplished by crudely making the mill out of stone blocks and different adhesive such as what was around, dirt, rocks, etc. combined with water. Each of the stone blocks used was of different size, which was not common to do in this time.  The mill from ground to top of roof is 43 feet high and had a total of three floors. The water-wheel, that is no longer attached to the building, was also rushed and crude in making. The water-wheel was (insert maker) 

## *Mill's Purpose*
The mill's overall main purpose was to replace the mills that were lost in Taos, NM. The United States government had reached out to St. Vrain in order to be a main supplier to the military installations around the area, the neighboring areas and the Navajo Indians which were currently being held in present-day Fort Sumner, NM.  

## (More about the esthetic of the mill)
  Currently this mill is in awful shape due to the lack of up-keep. Whole areas are in need of repair, which is 
  laid out in the letter to Mr. Ken Earl from R. Gordon McKeen, P.E. of McKeen Consulting Engineers, LLC.  

## *Closing of the Mill and Decline of Area*
- Research closing of the mill
- Research the decline of the area, the town, and what became of the area through the years
- Current status
(Still researching)

### Other mill sites:
- Research how close the other sites (mills and towns) where to this mill. Maybe in order to put into perspective to why he was chosen to feed the Navajos.

## Ceran St. Vrain, the man who built the mill
- Ceran St. Vrain was born on May 5, 1802 by aristocratic (parents) who fled the French Revolution to French Territory in St. Louis, Missouri. He ventured to New Mexico in 1825 at the age 23. He in his young-adulthood made his living selling fur. In 1834 he with the help of Charles and William Bent, the three of them helped establish ‘Brent’s Fort' on the Arkansas River. He his firm also established the St. Vrains trading post on the Platte River. In 1847, St. Vrain was given 4,000,000 acres of land in southern Colorado. The land grant was given to St. Vrain after revolts in Taos caused the death of his friend and Governor, Charles Bent. In 1847. St. Vrain led a militia (mostly) to crush the revolts in Taos, perpetrated by rebels made up of mostly Mexican and (Indians). In 1855 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in order to crush marauding bands of Utes and Apaches. During the civil war he was promoted to Colonel, but only kept the rank for a short amount of time before he retired and passed the rank on to another. St. Vrain seemed to be a jack of all trades, and even dabbled in local politics but after being defeated in his first and only run, he soon retired from that.
