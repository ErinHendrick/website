# St. Vrain's Mill
- Created in or around 1864, the St. Vrain's mill, located in Mora, New Mexico, and was used to fill the high-demand of flour by the US government during the tail end of the Civil-War and to feed thousands of Navajo Indians during the period of the 'Long Walk'. A number of revolts in Taos, NM, saw a number of the mills that were owned by Ceran St. Vrain be burned to the ground. This mill, though, rushed and crudely made, served a valuable function to not only the area but to other valuable areas as well, such as military forts and holding encampments.  It is currently still standing in Mora, NM, and is being persevered by the ‘St. Vrain Mill Preservation and Historical Foundation’, also located in Mora, NM. The Mill is located approximately 1500 feet north of the junction state roads 3 and 30 in Mora, NM. 

## Ceran St. Vrain's Stone Mill was constructed to resist fire which had destroyed another of his mills in Taos in the same year.
- The mill was created in a rush to meet high-demand and to replace what was lost in ,Taos. The overall main goal was to fire proof the mill. This was accomplished by crudley making the mill out of stone blocks and different adhesive such as what was around, dirt, rocks, etc, combined with water. Each of the stone blocks used was of different size, which was not common to do in this time.  The mill from ground to top of roof is 43 feet high and had  a total of three floors. The mill again was built in a hurry to meet demand and to also replace mills lost in Taos, NM. This meant that even the water-wheel, that is no longer attached to the building, was also rushed and crude in making. 

## Mill's purpose
 - Mill was used to supply neighboring areas as well as for the feeding of the Navajos that were being held in and around Fort Sumner, NM, then known as Sunnyside.   
 - Flour was in high demand at this time which is one of the suspected reasons to why this mill was constructed. 
 - It is speculated that this mill was created to make up for the mill lost because of fire in Taos, NM. 


## (More about the esthetic of the mill)
  Currently this mill is in awful shape due to the lack of up-keep. Whole areas are in need of repair, which is 
  laid out in the letter to Mr. Ken Earl from R. Gordon McKeen, P.E. of McKeen Consulting Engineers, LLC.  

## Closer of the Mill and Decline of area.
- Research closing of the mill
- Research the decline of the area, the town, and what became of the area through the years
- Current status
(Still researching)













## Ceran St. Vrain, the man who built the mill
- Ceran St. Vrain was born on May 5, 1802 by aristocratic (parents) who fled the French Revolution to French Territory in St. Louis, Missouri. He ventured to New Mexico in 1825 at the age 23. He in his young-adulthood made his living selling fur. In 1834 he with the help of Charles and William Bent, the three of them helped establish'Brent's Fort' on the Arkansas River. He his firm also established the St. Vrains trading post on the Platte River. In 1847, St. Vrain was given 4,000,000 acresof land in southern Colorado, This land grant was given to St. Vrain after revolts in Taos caused the death of his friend and Govenor, Charles Bent. In 1847. St. Vrain led a militia (mostly) to crush the revolts in Taos,perpetrated by rebels made up of mostly Mexican and (Indians). In 1855 he was promoted to lieutienant colonel in order to crush maruading bands of Utes and Apaches. During the civil war he was promoted to Colonel, but only kept the rank for a short amount of time before he retired and passed the rank on to another.

### Other mill sites:
- Research how close the other sites (mills and towns) where to this mill. Maybe in order to put into perspective to why he was chosen to feed the Navajos.
