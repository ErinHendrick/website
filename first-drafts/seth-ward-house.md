Located a quarter mile from the Kansas/Missouri state line, the Seth Ward House is in present-day Kansas City, Missouri. This homestead is positioned in the Country Club District, a group of neighborhoods containing upscale historical residences. Nearby in Jacob L. Loose park, visitors can see what was once the original farmland of the Ward homestead, which, in 1864, also doubled as the battlefield in the "Gettysburg of the West." This site is situated along the Santa Fe Trail, and was the home of two prominent tradesmen of the nineteenth century, William Bent and Seth Ward.


## Originally built as a farmhouse, this site soon became one of major historical significance. 
In the early 1800s, the land that would become the town of Westport, Missouri was home to Plains Indians and Mormon settlers who traveled across the west in the quest of converting Native Americans. By 1838 the "Mormon Wars" had come to an end, and with that more settlers flooded into the Missouri region, eventually establishing the grassroots of the Seth Ward homestead. (Shaw) In 1858, prominent tradesman, fort builder, and Indain peace-maker William Bent purchased the farmland and soon built a larger two story brick home on the property. Throughout the following decades, the house erected by Bent would endure a Civil War battle, the death of Bent himself, and the exchange of ownership to another distinguished frontiersman. 

## Battle of Westport
On October 23, 1864 Confederate Major General Sterling Price led a legendary raid into Missouri in hopes of forcing the loss of a border state. If the raid was successful, Abraham Lincoln would have had faced a challenging reelection, allowing the Confederacy the chance to negotiate a settlement. However, this raid was met head on by the Army of Missouri, leading to the largest Civil War battle west of the Mississippi River. (Beckenbaugh) The Battle of Westport, often referred to as the "Gettysburg of the West," was a major Union victory. This battle occurred on the pastureland of the William Bent farmstead. With about 3,000 Union and Confederate casualties combined, the Battle of Westport is forever entrenched in the ground of the Bent-Ward property. Today, the battleground is now a part of the Jacob L. Loose park in Kansas City, Missouri.
