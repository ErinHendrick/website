In nineteenth-century Missouri, it was very difficult to make a living. This large and comfortable house symbolizes Jones' wealth and status in Independence and demonstrates just how lucrative the [Santa Fe Trail](https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm) could be.

## Who Was Lewis Jones?

Lewis Jones was, first and foremost, a successful entrepreneur. He was a wagonmaker, trader, and merchant that also backed other traders on the Santa Fe trail; he also owned the Nebraska House Hotel (also in Independence).[^SFNH92] Jones did more than just conduct business. He was appointed a Justice of the County Court in 1831; he also founded the West Fork Baptist Church in December of 1842.[^NPS06]

Lewis Jones married Elizabeth Jones on January 6, 1820.[^NPS07] The couple had six children: Mary Jane Todd, Greenup C. Jones, Nancy C. Moore and Sally McClanahan, Melinda Caroline Spratt, and Clorissa Jones.[^NPS08] They lived in Independence until 1857 when they moved to Fremont, Colorado where Lewis was a rancher.[^NPS09]

## Independence and Trade in the American West

Independence, Missouri was the gateway to the American West. The town quickly became a bustling center for trade and migration after the [Louisiana Purchase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase) in 1803.[^MOI015] Since much of the West was still under Mexican control in the early 1840s, Independence served as an international trade hub.

Trade between Mexico and the United States relied almost entirely on the Santa Fe Trail.[^MOI138] Other wagon routes such as the [Oregon Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Trail) and the [California Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Trail) departed from Independence, as well.[^MOI038] American merchants also built a steady trade network with the Indian tribes of the West and various fur traders throughout the Rocky Mountains.[^MOI037]

Another prominent endeavor in Independence during the 1800s was the railroad industry. The Missouri and Independence River Railroad began in Independence in 1849, becoming a lucrative investment for local businessmen.[^MOI056]

## The House Itself

The Lewis Jones House was constructed in 1840 in the middle of Independence, Missouri. [^NPS10] It was built as a two-story, three-bay house with red brick walls and wood trim. [^NPS11] A porch was also built into the house on the first floor which covers one side of the house. [^NPS12] The house was later remodeled to include two more bays and to give the house a distinct L-Shape. [^NPS13] Throughout the years, the house has been able to maintain its historical integrity despite a changing city around it. This house embodies the popular architecture styles of the nineteenth century, but its primary historical significance comes from its resident.
