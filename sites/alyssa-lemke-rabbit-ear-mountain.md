# Rabbit Ear Mountain

Rabbit Ear mountain was an important landmark on the Santa Fe Trail because not only was it a visible landmark from all directions, including Texas, but it signaled sure and drinkable water for 30 miles. As a result, it would typically take a traveler four days to cross the valleys of the mountain, where they would simultaneously enjoy the constant access to water and the greenery for live stalk and travel animals to graze on. Once they left the assurance of this landmark, the next closet town was Clayton. This town is located to the north of Rabbit Ear mountain, and the closest town to the landmark. 

### How it got its name

It was named “Rabbit Ear” after the great Cheyenne Chief Orejo de Conejos, whose name translates to ‘Rabbits Ear’, who was killed in a bloody battle with the Spanish settlers in 1717. It was said that his name was given to him due to a damaged ear from frostbite. He was buried on top of the larger mountain and these volcanic hills were name after him to memorialize his bravery against the Spanish. 

### The Battle

The story of the battle of Rabbit Ear Mountain is told in the perspective of the Spanish-American settlers, taking place in 1717. In this story, the battle started after some Comanches were holding several Spanish prisoners’ hostage. As a result, an expedition of about 500 soldiers was sent from Santa Fe to attempt to release these prisoners. The expedition was well armed and after learning that the Comanche were camped at Rabbit Ear, they preceded to charge the camp at daylight. This killed hundreds and are said to have taken 700 Comanches prisoner. The battle was extremely bloody and, in the end, the Spanish captives were liberated form the Comanches. As a result, it was said that the Comanche never again went on the warpath against the Spaniards and a treaty was made to cease the fighting between the two. 

### Terrain

The hills are remnants of volcanoes and part of the larger Raton-Clayton Volcanic Field, and therefore depends on the area as to if the ground is firm, loose, or sandy, as well as ranging from flat plains to ridges and valleys. The Spring is when water is the most plentiful, and therefore the best time of year for men and women traveling the Santa Fe Tail to pass though. It has large grassy areas for animals to graze and travelers to camp for the night, making it somewhat of a haven on their rough adventure. The twin peaks are 6,062 ft, the larger one being Rabbit Ear Mountain, and the smaller one being Rabbit Ear Butte due to the steep sides’ and a flat top.

### Visiting Today

Rabbit Ear is considered one of the most preserved and nearly untouched landmarks apart of the Santa Fe Trail. The three spots that were frequently used as camps by the travelers were all located by sources of water. Today, these are now places where people can camp as well. These campsites are located and open to visitors: the McNees Crossing on Corrumpa (or McNees) Creek, Turkey Creek Camp on what is now called Alamos Creek, and Rabbit Ears Camp on Cienequilla Creek.
