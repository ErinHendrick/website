# Rabbit Ear Mountain

Rabbit Ear mountain was an important landmark on the Santa Fe Trail because kt not only was a visible landmark from all directions, including Texas, but it indicated a reliable source of drinkable water for 30 miles. After passing the desolate desert before reaching Rabbit Ear, water and edable greenary was sparce for travelers. One a traveler would reach the Mountian, they would typically meander though the area for four days, enjoying the natural resources. These groups of men, women, and children would cross the valleys of the mountain and emerge from the landscape replenish and rejuvinated. Once they left this safe haven, the next closet town that provided travelers with necessities, was Clayton New Mexico located to the north of the Mountain.

### How it got its name

Rabbit Ear Mountain was named “Rabbit Ear” after the great Cheyenne Chief Orejo de Conejos, whose name translates to ‘Rabbits Ear’. He was given this name due to his supposed damaged ear caused by frostbite when he was a child. According to the popular story told by the early Spanihs settelers, this Chief was killed in a bloody battle with the Spanish Army in 1717. After the battel, Orejo de Conejos was buried on top of the larger of the two volcanic hills, and therefore nameed after him to memorialize his bravery against the Spanish. 

### The Battle

The story of the battle of Rabbit Ear Mountain is told in the perspective of the Spanish-American settlers, taking place in 1717. In this legendary story, the battle started after some Comanche Indians were holding several Spanish hostage. As a result, an expedition of about 500 soldiers was sent from Santa Fe to attempt to free these prisoners from thier bondage. The expedition was well armed and equipped as they moved out toward Rabbit Ear after learning that they were camped out there. Once the Spanish forces arrived, they decided to charge the camp at daylight. This battle killed hundreds, both Spanish and Comanche, and the Spanish was said to have taken 700 Comanches prisoner. The Spanish were successful in freeing the captives. It is also roumered that the Comanche never again went on the warpath against the Spaniards and a treaty was made to cease the fighting between the two grpups.

The hills are remnants of volcanoes and part of the larger Raton-Clayton Volcanic Field, and therefore depends on the area as to if the ground is firm, loose, or sandy, as well as ranging from flat plains to ridges and valleys. The Spring is when water is the most plentiful, and therefore the best time of year for men and women traveling the Santa Fe Tail to pass though. It has large grassy areas for animals to graze and travelers to camp for the night, making it somewhat of a haven on their rough adventure. The twin peaks are 6,062 ft, the larger one being Rabbit Ear Mountain, and the smaller one being Rabbit Ear Butte due to the steep sides’ and a flat top.

### Visiting Today

Rabbit Ear is considered one of the most preserved and nearly untouched landmarks apart of the Santa Fe Trail. The three spots that were frequently used as camps by the travelers were all located by sources of water. Today, these are now places where people can camp as well. These campsites are located and open to visitors: the McNees Crossing on Corrumpa (or McNees) Creek, Turkey Creek Camp on what is now called Alamos Creek, and Rabbit Ears Camp on Cienequilla Creek.
