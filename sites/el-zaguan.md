James L. Johnson was a prominent merchant tied to the Santa Fe Trail from 1845-1881. In that time, he was able to make a place for himself in this trade network and gain enough revenues to create his house ‘El Zaguan’. He moved to [Santa Fe](https://santafe.org/), in 1845, and became immersed in its culture and adopted it as his home. James L. Johnson created his house that came to represent the mixing of the Anglo newcomers and Hispanic and Native American traditions, already established in New Mexico, which the trail provided. 

### **House and Garden of El Zaguan**

El Zaguan grew from a small farmhouse built of adobe, which Johnson purchased in 1854, into a vast property. It included the house with multiple rooms, a large flower garden, a vegetable garden, stables, corrals, a smoke shed, and shelters for chickens and hogs[^1] The name El Zaguan, refers to the courtyard right behind the main entrance, and was given to the property under a future owner, Margretta Dietrich, who ran a hotel there.  The house, about a fifteen-minute walk from the Santa Fe plaza and end of the Santa Fe Trail, was isolated at its time. The house provided farmable land and was perfectly set near the river, with an [acequia](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/05/acequias/), or irrigation ditch, that provided Johnson’s property with water. In New Mexico’s arid climate access to water and water rights have always been highly contested. This acequia brought him into the local acequia community. Along with the water rights came the responsibility to provide someone to help clean the ditch and do maintenance work once a year. These water rights made it possible to grow the lush garden that is still accessible today. Nicknamed the ‘Bandelier Garden’ after [Adolph Bandelier](http://newmexicohistory.org/2014/01/16/adolf-bandelier-a-biography-by-william-h-wroth/), a prominent archeologist of the Southwest during this time period, who was a guest, along with his wife, and lived with the Johnsons at El Zaguan from April 3, 1891 to May 1892[^2]. The [garden has](https://www.gardenvisit.com/gardens/the_garden_at_el_zaguan) over a hundred-year-old peony bushes that were imported from China[^3] and also horse chestnut trees that have come to represent their garden.

The lushness and fine care of the garden, which was looked after by Johnson’s wife, came to represent the prestige and wealth he had within the community. “The garden was planted by the late Mrs. Johnson and contained many Madonna lilies, peonies, and the wonderful horse chestnut trees which provided what looked like an oasis in the desert on the hot summer days.”[^4] It meant a lot that he was able to put aside this land for a flower garden rather than keeping it as productive land. It symbolized his security which was provided by the Santa Fe Trail. 

His corrals served as a stopping point for the oxen and horses that had worked the entire trail[^5]. It marked the end of the road for some merchants working for him and just a mid-point for others. His corrals became a place for the stock animals to rest and be fed before they started again on their journey back to Missouri or on to Mexico. El Zaguan represented a stopping place for the Trail, it was a place to swap ideas and news, and the unloading of goods for a profit, but also a permanent home for Johnson.

### **James L. Johnsons's Beginning in New Mexico**

James L. Johnson grew up in Maryland. In 1845 at the age of twenty he made his first trip along the Santa Fe Trail, stopping in Santa Fe and continuing on the Camino Real into Mexico. After coming back into New Mexico, he worked as a clerk for a while[^6], before he became a junior partner with Preston Beck Jr. Together they ran one of the oldest established wholesale and retail businesses in Santa Fe[^7]. In 1858 Preston died, from a knife wound he sustained a week before during a fight to the death with a clerk in another store, who was killed during the fight[^8]. After this dramatic event Johnson inherited the business and business block located on the northeast end of the Plaza of Santa Fe. 

The newspapers by the 1870’s described Johnson as one of the most successful merchants. He worked in wholesale and retail trade still but had also ventured into real estate, banking and mining[^9]. Johnson was able to do really well for himself and his business and this became reflected in the house he built for himself.

### **The Property he Built for Himself**

In 1854 Johnson bought a farmhouse and property on [Canyon Road](https://www.visitcanyonroad.com/), about a fifteen-minute walk from the plaza, for $250[^10]. The house was in a Hispanic neighborhood and across the Santa Fe river from the plaza. This was very different from the other prominent merchants at this time who were sreating a new Anglo neighborhood on East Palace Avenue[^11], which is located directly East of the plaza. Johnson’s business block was located at the west end of East Palace Avenue. Johnson instead chose to live in an already established Hispanic neighborhood because he related more to the culture of New Mexico than the Anglo culture of the newcomers. In part because Johnson was married to Maria Jesus (Jesusita) Montoya from Mexico, with which he had seven surviving children[^12]. As his family grew so did his house and additional parcels of land were purchased in 1857, 1864, and 1875[^13]. El Zaguan grew into a 24-room mansion on the outskirts of town[^14].

### **His Successes and His Failures**

During this time Johnson bought other properties on Canyon Road, including servants’ quarters across the street and property closer to the river that served as an orchard and corn field[^15]. He also owned a thirty-three-lot subdivision on the other side of town south of the Presbyterian Church, and behind the modern day El Dorado hotel and the Santa Fe County Clerk Office. The property was so big that when he opened it up in 1880 as a street, he was able to name it. This street was originally named Garfield Street after the President who was inaugurated in 1881. By 1886 the street was renamed [Johnson Street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Johnson+St,+Santa+Fe,+NM+87501/@35.6891736,-105.9445333,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x87185040a02c6c27:0x36bab77bc3862cc8!8m2!3d35.6891736!4d-105.9423446), which it is still called today[^16].

Johnson acquired a lot of wealth from his business connected to the Santa Fe Trail, which he invested in all of his properties around town. Unfortunately, with the arrival of the Rail Road to New Mexico the prosperity of the trail disappeared. This was also during the time of the [Long Depression](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2016/02/crisis-chronicles-the-long-depression-and-the-panic-of-1873.html) which led to further losses of profits. This forced Johnson to mortgage most of his property to [Thomas B. Catron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_B._Catron), a successful lawyer and politician who had served as a district attorney, and territorial Attorney General of New Mexico. His most prominent positions were as Mayor of Santa Fe from 1906 to 1908 and as one of the first Senators for the State of New Mexico from 1912 to 1916. In 1881 Johnson had failed to pay back his debt owed to Catron and a majority of his property, including El Zaguan went to Catron. This is why Johnson’s business block is called the Catron Block to this day[^17].

### **Architectural Style of the Building**

Throughout his time of owning El Zaguan, Johnson constructed the building in [Territorial Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Style). He utilized earlier Spanish Colonial Styles and combined them with new materials available in New Mexico thanks to the Santa Fe Trail and design influence from the East. The style that was influential in the East at the time was [Greek Revival](https://www.wentworthstudio.com/historic-styles/greek-revival/), as exemplified by buildings recreating Greek Temples like the White House or the Lincoln Memorial. From this style New Mexico adopted copings replicating dentalium, pediments, and columns. Large panes of glass came along the Trail allowing for large vertical windows. These windows used milled wood for pediment lintel trims. Glass was very rare in New Mexico before this trade route opened, because of the size of the manufacturing operation it would require. This was also true about bricks, with the first introduction of bricks in the region they were used just as details. They were used as coping to look like dentalium patterns that were taken from Greek classical buildings. The last new material that came on the Trail was thin square milled columns with small capitals[^18]. 

### **Johnson Compared to Merchants of the Time**

The overlap between the local vernacular buildings and the inclusion of new styles from the East in his house perfectly portrays the style of Johnson as a merchant on the Trail. The typical story of Anglo traders on the Santa Fe Trail, like the Spiegelber brothers, the Staabs, and the Seligmans, is: they came from Europe, worked with their family, lived in the Anglo merchant neighborhood on East Palace Avenue, did not make local connections and left after the Trail phased out.  

Johnson was from the United States of America and he had grown up on the same continent as where the Santa Fe Trail was operating. He moved away from his family and all relations to work on the Trail, which was different than most traders who became partners with their own brothers or cousins. He started working as a merchant on the Santa Fe Trail at the young age of twenty years old and traveled between the States, Territories, and Mexico. He met his wife, who was Mexican, during one of his trips to Mexico. Maria Jesus (Jesusita) Montoya was born in 1832 in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. They started a family and they had seven surviving children[^19], creating roots within New Mexico. As he settled in his new home in Santa Fe he adopted more of the local culture. He came to New Mexico along the Trail to make money, but ended up finding a new home and was not solely focused on the economic venture. 

This adoption of local culture and style can be seen in his house. It was built in New Mexico Territorial Style rather than an Eastern style such as Victorian. He kept the integrity of the vernacular Spanish farmhouse he bought. The same adobe walls that were there when he purchased the first piece of El Zaguan still stand today. His additions to the original style were minimal and supplied by the Trail in the fashion of every other vernacular building of the time. His house was also different as a merchant’s house because he built it in an already established Hispanic neighborhood. All of the other merchants of the time were constructing houses along East Palace Avenue and segregating themselves into their own Anglo community. This again shows his acquired interest in this new territory. The last big difference between him and the other prominent merchants of the time was that after the trail fell and he lost his fortune he still stayed in Santa Fe. He had established roots less than forty years after his first trip on the Santa Fe Trail and remained in the house he had created for himself in the new community he took on.

### **The Legacy of El Zaguan**

Even after Johnson lost the ownership of El Zaguan he continued to live in the building until his death in 1897. Catron kept the building in the family until it was sold in 1918 to Johnson’s grandson James Baca. The Building ended up in the ownership of [Margretta Stewart Dietrich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margretta_Dietrich) who saved it from being demolished and turned it into an apartment complex. Dietrich had moved to New Mexico with her sister after being widowed. Her husband was a former governor of Nebraska and a US senator. Dietrich fought for women’s suffrage. She was also an activist for Native American rights and served as the chairwoman of the New Mexico Association of Indian Affairs for over twenty years. As the owner of El Zaguan she operated it as a hotel for some time, which was when it acquired the name El Zaguan. Dietrich valued the Territorial style of the house and restored it in that style rather than the Spanish Pueblo Revival Style that was popular at the time. After her death the property was owned by El Zaguan, Inc., a corporation led by famous New Mexico architect [John Gaw Meem](https://newmexicohistory.org/2012/06/29/buildings-designed-by-john-gaw-meem-1925-1959/)[^20], until 1979 when it passed fully to the Historic Santa Fe Foundation[^21]. It is now the home of the [Historic Santa Fe Foundation](https://www.historicsantafe.org/), where its history and preservation live on while also serving as the house to multiple artists and writers and creating a gallery space for local artists to display their work.
