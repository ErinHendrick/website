# **El Zaguan**

James L. Johnson was a prominent merchant tied to the Santa Fe Trail from 1845-1881. In that time, he was able to make a place for himself in this trade network and gain enough revenues to create his house ‘El Zaguan’. He moved to Santa Fe and became immersed in its culture and adopted it as his home which was very different than the other merchants at the time. James L. Johnson created his house that came to represent the mixing of the Anglo newcomers and Hispanic and Native American traditions, already established in New Mexico, which the trail provided. 

### **House and Garden of El Zaguan**

El Zaguan grew from a small farmhouse built of adobe, which Johnson purchased in 1854, into a house with multiple rooms, a large flower garden, a vegetable garden, stables, corrals, a smoke shed, and shelters for chickens and hogs[^1]  The house, about a fifteen-minute walk from the plaza, was isolated at its time. The house provided farmable land and was perfectly set near the river. This meant that there was an acequia that provided Johnson’s property with water. An acequia is an irrigation ditch. In New Mexico’s arid climate access to water and water rights have always been highly contested. This acequia brought him into the local acequia community. Along with the water rights came the responsibility to provide someone to help clean the ditch and do maintenance work once a year. These water rights made possible to grow the lush garden that is still accessible today. Nicknamed the ‘Bandelier Garden’ after Adolph Bandelier, a prominent archeologist of the Southwest during this time period, who was a guest, along with his wife, and lived with the Johnsons at El Zaguan from April 3, 1891 to May 1892[^2]. The garden has over a hundred-year-old peony bushes that were imported from China[^3] and also horse chestnut trees that have come to represent their garden. 

The lushness and fine care of the garden, which was looked after by Johnson’s wife, came to represent the prestige and wealth he had within the community. “The garden was planted by the late Mrs. Johnson and contained many Madonna lilies, peonies, and the wonderful horse chestnut trees which provided what looked like an oasis in the desert on the hot summer days.”[^4] It meant a lot that he was able to put aside this land for a flower garden rather than keeping it as productive land. It symbolized his security which was provided by the Santa Fe Trail. 

His corrals served as a stopping point for the oxen and horses that had worked the entire trail[^5]. It marked the end of the road for some merchants working for him and just a mid-point for others. His corrals became a place for the stock animals to rest and be fed before they started again on their journey back to Missouri or on to Mexico. El Zaguan represented a stopping place for the Trail, it was a place to swap ideas and news, and the unloading of goods for a profit, but also a permanent home for Johnson. 

### **James L. Johnsons's Beginning in New Mexico**

James L. Johnson grew up in Maryland. In 1845 at the age of twenty he made his first trip along the Santa Fe Trail, stopping in Santa Fe and continuing on the Camino Real into Mexico. After coming back into New Mexico, he worked as a clerk for a while[^6]. He became a junior partner with Preston Beck Jr. Together they ran one of the oldest established wholesale and retail businesses in Santa Fe[^7]. In 1858 Preston died. He had been in a fight to the death the week before his death with a man named Gorman, who was a clerk in another store. Gorman had been killed during the fight and Preston had sustained a knife wound that later killed him[^8]. After this dramatic event Johnson inherited the business and business block located on the northeast end of the Plaza of Santa Fe. 

By the 1870’s Johnson was described as one of the most successful merchants. He worked in wholesale and retail trade still but had also ventured into real estate, banking and mining[^9]. Johnson was able to do really well for himself and his business and this became reflected in the house he built for himself. 

### **The Property he Built for Himself**

In 1854 Johnson bought a farmhouse and property on Canyon Road, about a fifteen-minute walk from the plaza, for $250[^10]. The house was in a Hispanic neighborhood and across the Santa Fe river from the plaza. This was very different from the other prominent merchants at this time who were starting a new Anglo neighborhood on East Palace Avenue[^11], which is located directly East of the plaza. Johnson’s business block was located at the west end of East Palace Avenue. Johnson instead chose to live in an already established Hispanic neighborhood because he related more to that culture of New Mexico than the Anglo culture of the newcomers. Johnson was married to Maria Jesus (Jesusita) Montoya from Mexico. Together they started a family and had seven surviving children[^12]. As his family grew so did his house and additional parcels of land were purchased in 1857, 1864, and 1875[^13]. El Zaguan grew into a 24-room mansion on the outskirts of town[^14].

### **His Successes and His Failures**

During this time Johnson bought other properties on Canyon Road, including servants’ quarters across the street and property closer to the river that served as an orchard and corn field[^15]. He also owned a thirty-three-lot subdivision on the other side of town south of the Presbyterian Church, and behind the modern day El Dorado hotel and the Santa Fe County Clerk Office. The property was so big that when he opened it up in 1880 as a street, he was able to name it. This street was originally named Garfield Street after the President who was inaugurated in 1881. By 1886 the street was renamed Johnson Street, which it is still called today[^16].

Johnson acquired a lot of wealth from his business connected to the Santa Fe Trail, which he invested in all of his properties around town. Unfortunately, with the arrival of the Rail Road to New Mexico the prosperity of the trail disappeared. This was also during the time of the Long Depression which led to further losses of profits. (research long depression) As this downfall was occurring Johnson mortgaged most of his property to Thomas B. Catron. At the time Catron was a successful lawyer and politician who had served as a district attorney, and territorial Attorney General of New Mexico. His most prominent positions were as Mayor of Santa Fe from 1906 to 1908 and as one of the first Senators for the State of New Mexico from 1912 to 1916. In 1881 Johnson had failed to pay back his debt owed to Catron and a majority of his property, including El Zaguan went to Catron. This is why Johnson’s business block is called the Catron Block to this day. (HBS 223, 23-24)
