# Fort Larned National Historic Site
Fort Larned was an American military post near Larned, Kansas that was in operation from 1859 to 1878. It was one of several frontier forts that were established in the 1800's to protect trade routes, such as the Santa Fe Trail, and to act as launching points for military campaigns against Native Americans on the western frontier. Fort Larned was one of those forts positioned along the Santa Fe Trail, and it held special significance for travellers on the trail, and for both the US military and the Native American tribes of the Great Plains. 

Today, Fort Larned is one of the best-preserved examples of these forts, and is a prominent National Park Service exhibit.[^ZwinkPreface]

In 1848, the [Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Guadalupe_Hidalgo) ended the Mexican-American War. Shortly afterwards, with the [Gadsden Purchase of 1854](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsden_Purchase), and several other land acquisitions, the United States had secured the western territory that would create the borders that we know today. With this new frontier opened up, settlers began to pour in. In the early 19th century, the US military’s goal in the West was simple:

>[The Army’s policy between] 1804-1845 was marked by the army maintaining a line of forts in advance of surging frontier settlements, thus creating a buffer military zone between pioneer settlers and native Indians. By this procedure, the government planned to control the Indians, preventing them from committing anticipated attacks against advancing white frontiersmen. Officials in Washington, D. C., also desired to protect the Indians, particularly those removed previously from the eastern United States, by defusing potential intertribal warfare and by preventing illegal and unscrupulous activities of whites.[^ZwinkQuote1]

However, with the frontier now entirely claimed by the U.S., this idea of having a "buffer zone" no longer applied. It was decided that more permanent forts were needed, and it also came to light that the policy toward Native Americans should change. This new policy called for clamping down on the natives, using military force to keep them in their reservations and away from white settlers. Dozens of new forts sprung up across the West, including Fort Larned, and a series of major conflicts with the Native Americans (the largest campaigns of the [Indian Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_Wars)) started, with these forts as their focal points.[^Zwink4]

However, this was not the only reason these forts were created. During this period, trade routes to the West, most notably the Santa Fe Trail, substantially increased in both traffic and value of shipped goods. These frontier forts and their soldiers became the only force of law on these trails, and the only form of protection many travellers had.[^Unrau]


## The Fort

The first iteration of Fort Larned was called "Camp on the Pawnee Fork", and was located on the Pawnee River, at the base of Lookout Hill (now called “Jenkins Hill”). This was a small camp, consisting of tents and other temporary structures. The site was moved to a more permanent location in 1859, to a bend in the river overlooking the plains, and was given the name “Fort Larned” after the US army paymaster, Col. Benjamin F. Larned. [^Unrau]

The fort overlooked large stretches of the plains to the north and south, and was bordered by groves of hardwood trees along the river. The river itself acted as a moat along the northwest edge of the fort, giving it a natural barrier against any threats. [^NRHP] Because of this natural defence, Fort Larned was never built up like a traditional fort, with large walls or entrenchments. Despite its name, Fort Larned was really more of a small garrison than a proper fort. 

From the perspective of the US military, the fort’s construction was an instant success. Fort Larned had become one of the primary distribution points for annuities sent to Native American tribes, and its location made it an important spot for American and Native leaders to meet.

Before the creation of Fort Larned, Santa Fe Trail travellers were left unguarded for the entire stretch of trail between [Fort Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Riley), Kansas and [Fort Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Union_National_Monument), New Mexico. Its presence on the Trail lowered the frequency of Native American attacks considerably, to the point where in 1961, [Colonel Jesse Leavenworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Henry_Leavenworth), the commanding officer of Fort Larned, stated that Natives had completely left the Santa Fe Trail area, and that there was no sign of hostilities in the near future. However, the onset of the Civil War would bring about a new wave of unrest in the plains.[^Unrau]


## Early Interactions with Native Americans
In the 1830’s and 1840’s, with the increase in development of Texas, and its adoption as a state, Apache and Cheyenne tribes in northern Texas were forcibly moved further north, into western Kansas. The increased Native American population led to a sharp decline in the buffalo population, and a scarcity of resources for the native tribes living off the land. Coupled with the increased traffic on the Santa Fe Trail, this forced many natives in the area to turn to looting and raiding to survive.[^Unrau] Reports from people travelling the trail talked about running into large groups of natives waiting at strategic points in the trail, coercing the travellers to give them food in exchange for safe passage, or just looking for any opportunity to steal from the wagons.[^Zwink78]

Over the course of the Civil War, with many American troops having gone off to the east to fight the Confederacy, the fighting over resources on the Santa Fe Trail intensified. This would lead to the “Nine Mile Ridge Massacre”, about 75 miles west of Fort Larned[^Zwink82]: 

>In January, 1863, a wagon train that was preparing to bed down for the night was surrounded by a group of hungry Indians who demanded food and coffee. In the excitement that followed, a teamster wounded one of the Indians. This prompted them to return before daylight and massacre all the teamsters, excluding one who escaped to the protection of Fort Larned.[^Unrau]

The fort itself would also become involved in several incidents with the Natives, and was raided several times:

>In that same year a group of destitute Kiowas, under the guise of wanting to trade, ran off 300 cattle from Fort Larned… 
[In] August [...], Little Heart, en route from his Cheyenne village just west of Fort Larned to the fort for the purpose of obtaining supplies, was shot by a sentry. It was later determined that Little Heart had been drunk and that he had attempted to ride over Isaac Marrs, the sentry.[^Unrau]

The relationship between the Native Americans and the soldiers of the fort was not all bad, however. In January of that same year, a group from the [Caddo confederacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddo) wandered up to Fort Larned, hoping to find somewhere to settle down. They had fled their village after their [Indian agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_agent) had left them to join the Confederate army. The authorities at Fort Larned were sympathetic to them, and managed to get them a chunk of money and a large swath of land across the river to set up farms.[^Report] Unfortunately, relations between the US government and the tribes of the Great Plains would only get worse, and a year later, a war started. The Caddo farmers fled, hoping not to get caught in the crossfire.[^Unrau]

## Indian War of 1864

In 1864, as tensions came to a head, warfare broke out across the plains, and violence swept the entire region. In the summer, a group of 60 teamsters were attacked just west of Fort Larned. Many of them were killed, and one survivor was rescued later, after he had been captured and tortured by the natives. In the winter, the infamous [Sand Creek Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_Creek_massacre) took place in the Colorado Territory, where an entire Native American village was slaughtered.[^Zwink88]

Throughout the year, Fort Larned was constantly raided for its supplies, especially its livestock and horses, and the surrounding area suffered from countless native attacks. One incident in particular almost took out the fort entirely:

>On July 17, 1864, [...] the Indians were allowed to enter and move around the post without any restrictions. At the same time, however, they were planning a scheme to massacre the entire garrison. A square dance was to be held, and there the soldiers would be away from their weapons. Meanwhile, the Indians planned to infiltrate the fort, and at a prearranged signal would launch a surprise attack. The scheme partially was exposed by accident. Approximately three hours before the designated time for the attack and prior to the arrival of the Indians from their camps, a rumor circulated among the civilians and soldiers at the post, claiming that there was possible danger of Indian attack. The rumor reportedly originated from information that an interpreter had overheard from the Indians. Inasmuch as rumors of Indian attacks were quite common, there was no great alarm and no attention was given to the alleged attack. [...] The officer of the day, nevertheless, decided to order the guards to keep all other Indians from entering the post. The Kiowa chief, Satank, was the leader of the attack, but when he approached a sentry near the sutler's store, he was refused entry into the garrison. Satank became irritated, and the Kiowa chieftain first shot an arrow at the sentry and then fired a revolver. Wounded in the hand, the guard returned the fire, killing a Mexican who was riding behind Satank, apparently the Kiowa's aide. This exchange of gunfire prematurely triggered the attack. Consequently, the Indians abandoned their initial objective of a massacre and instead scrambled to confiscate the garrison's livestock. More than 200 mules and horses were lost--all the livestock of the post.[^Zwink85]

No other attempts at directly attacking the fort ever came, but fighting in the area would continue until early 1865. At this point, Col. Leavenworth (who had become the Indian Agent for the Kiowa and Comanche) wanted to try to find a way to stop the bloodshed. In October, he met with leaders from Kiowa, Comanche, Plains Apache, Arapahoe, and Cheyenne tribes near the Little Arkansas River. Theoretically, this meeting was a success, as every leader present signed new treaties with the US government. In actuality, not every group within those tribes agreed with the treaties, or considered them to be binding in any way. The more militant groups, especially those within the Cheyenne, did not take those treaties to heart, and continued raiding throughout 1866 and 1867.[^Zwink89]

The situation got to the point where the US army decided it needed to send a message, and in the spring of 1867, Major [General Winfield Scott Hancock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winfield_Scott_Hancock) and the men under his command were sent to Fort Larned. 


## Hancock’s War

>"My object of making an expedition at this time is to show the Indians that we are able to chastise any tribes who may molest people who are traveling across the plains. It is not our desire to bring on difficulties with the Indians, but to treat them with justice and according to our treaty stipulations, and desire especially in my dealings with them to act through their Agent as far as practicable. I will go fully prepared for peace or war." - General Winfield S. Hancock

Hancock started gathering troops in Fort Riley for his expedition on April 3, 1867. There, he picked up the 7th Calvary, and with it, [Lt. Colonel George Custer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Armstrong_Custer), who would be leading the cavalry units in this campaign. They arrived at Fort Larned on April 7, where they stayed until the 13th, when they met with several Cheyenne chiefs. Hancock’s main goal was to intimidate the chiefs:

>"You know very well, if you go to war with the white man you will lose… .I have a great many chiefs with me that have commanded more men than you ever saw, and they have fought more great battles than you have fought fights." - General Winfield S. Hancock

This meeting accomplished nothing, so Hancock’s next plan was to go out and meet with other chiefs, and attempt to intimidate them with his army. On the 14th, his expedition set out to march to a nearby Cheyenne and Lakota village. On their way, they ran into a group of native soldiers, who proposed that they meet the following day. Hancock accepted, but when he went to the village the next day, he found that the natives had fled during the night. Hancock was incensed, and ordered for the village to be burned down. 

His justification was that their escape signified their guilt in being conspirators, and was a sign of war. In truth, after the villagers had heard about an American army coming to visit, they thought that they would be the victim of another Sand Creek Massacre. This action would spark off a series of attacks and skirmishes across the plains, now called Hancock’s War. 

Ultimately, Hancock failed at his task of reigning in the Plains Indians, and was relieved of his post at Fort Larned. Although his expedition really didn’t accomplish much, the aftermath of Hancock’s War would be a driving force behind the Medicine Lodge Treaty. 


## The Medicine Lodge Treaty

%}

In the fall of 1867, tribal leaders from all the Great Plains tribes agreed to meet at Medicine Lodge Creek, in southern Kansas. Preliminary talks began at Fort Larned, and after they had gathered, the peace commission left for Medicine Lodge Creek on October 13. In a process that has been repeated throughout the US since the signing of the Indian Removal Act, all of the Native American leaders signed treaties to give the United States their land in exchange for reservations further west, as well as a large amount of gifts and annuities. 

Fort Larned ended up being the shipping point for all of these gifts. The amount given was so much that it took about a month just for the goods to be organized and shipped to the post at Medicine Lodge Creek. 


## Last Years In The Military
With these new treaties in place, the majority of the Native Americans in Kansas had been removed, and Fort Larned became much less useful to the military. The expeditions of Generals [Sheridan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Sheridan#Indian_Wars) and Custer came through the Midwest soon afterwards, and completely wiped away any further resistance by the natives. 

In 1868, Fort Larned’s annuity distribution center was closed, as there were no one left to pay annuities to.  The fort stayed operational for about ten more years, but the garrison was reduced to only a couple hundred soldiers. Over this time, operations slowly wound down, until the fort was abandoned in 1878.
