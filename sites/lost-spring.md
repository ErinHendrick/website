Lost Spring was a crucial site for travelers on the Santa Fe Trail because of its water. A naturally occurring spring that sometimes flowed and sometimes didnt (hence the name 'lost'), Lost Spring helped travelers replenish a critical resource during their long journey.

## The Source

The source of water at Lost Spring is not the Rocky Mountains as in local legend, but the [Flint Hills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_Hills) to the east, a limestone and flint rock outcropping that was covered by sea during the Permian geologic period, about 300 million years ago. Because of the rockiness of this region farmers never disturbed the tallgrass prairie. It remains the largest contiguous grassland of its kind and is now an EPA designated [ecoregion](http://www.kansasnativeplantsociety.org/ecoregions.php) This undisturbed region is the source of 14 springs in Marion county, Kansas. At Lost Spring, as bedrock dips, water appears and later returns to the sandy soil of the site. (Schmidt, 18)

One diarist’s 1848 description of Lost Spring was, "Came to a place, called 'Lost Spring', a most singular curiosity. The stream rises suddenly out of the ground, and after rushing over the sand a few yards, as suddenly sinks, and is no more seen" (Richardson, 11). 

For travelers on such a long and perilous journey, this spontaneous provision must have seemed like a gift from God. 

## Water Is Life

Although missionaries , most of the traffic during the heyday of the Santa Fe Trail between 1821 and 1880 (when the railroad was introduced) was made up of merchants from the east. The Santa Fe Trail was an international route, linking goods from the United States, which could have originated in Europe, to the territory of Mexico. Water was a vital resource for the purposes of commerce. Usually travelers left in the cool of the evening carrying as much water as they could. Travelers used barrels and water kegs, however, some wagons only carried one 5-gallon keg of water (Smith, 29). 

As the Santa Fe trail is 870 miles long, travelers had to replenish this resource as often as they could and finding sources along the way was crucial to survival. Water from springs was especially desirable, since it was cool and fresh, compared to water near trail crossings which were contaminated with animal waste, or pools which could be warm and stagnant. 

Aside from human consumption, animals were a consideration. Most wagons were pulled by oxen, and mules and horses were also used on the trail. Travelers also transported all manner of livestock, including cattle, sheep, and even pigs. Historian Steve Schmidt estimates that over 15,000 mules and oxen were used to pull 1,558 wagons over the trail between 1822 and 1843 (3). Travelers caring for livestock had to time their travels so that grass and water would be available.

Lost Spring, located 15 miles west from Diamond Spring and 17 miles east of Cottonwood Crossing, was a relatively secure spot, water-wise, *if* the spring was flowing. However, further west water sources were nonexistent. 

The most dangerous part of the trail because of lack of water was called the “Jornada,” meaning expedition, a part of the trail 60 miles long between the Arkansas river and Wagonbed spring. 
William Becknell, so-called "Father of the Santa Fe Trail" (one of the first to travel the trail, in 1821), supposedly [ran out of water](https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/morton-county-kansas/15320) on this part of the trail. He and his team tried killing their dogs and cutting off their mules’ ears to drink their blood, so dehydrated were they. However, their expedition was saved when they spotted a bison gorged with water and drank from its stomach, later following its trail to a water source. 

Journals kept by travelers on the trail recount the prominent role searching for water had on their trail experience.  
The journal of [Meredith Miles Marmaduke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meredith_Miles_Marmaduke), a trader on the Santa Fe Trail who later became a politician in the United States, describes crossing the Jornada in 1824: 
>“Traveled 30 miles; left our encampment at 4 o’clock, a.m., and travelled without making any halt until about 4 o’clock p.m., without a drop of water for our horses or mules, by which time many of them were nearly exhausted, as well as a number of the men; a dog which had travelled with us during our journey, this day fell down and expired, such was the extreme heat and suffering. Fortunately for us all at about 4 o’clock a small ravine was discovered and pursued for a few miles, and after digging in the sand at the bottom of it, water was procured in sufficient quantity to satisfy both man and horse, but not till after five or six wells were sunk; and such was the extreme suffering of the animals that it was with the utmost difficulty could be kept out of the holes until buckets could be filled for them. I never in my life experienced a time when such general alarm and consternation pervaded every person on account of the want of water.” 

[Susan Shelby Magoffin](http://www.womenhistoryblog.com/2014/05/susan-shelby-magoffin.html), the plucky young bride of a merchant, traveling in 1846, also describes being far from water: “We traveled till 11 o’clock with the hope of finding water…the oxen staggered under their yokes. One poor thing fell in the road and we almost gave him up for lost. His driver, though, a rather tender hearted lad, I presume…got all the water from the water kegs after the men had drank and opening the ox’s mouth poured it down his throat.” The ox wandered off in the night still searching for water and was not retrieved. 

Another danger for merchants, besides running out of water, was being a visitor on lands that others had called their home for thousands of years. As Council Grove was the last trading point between the start of the trail and its destination of Santa Fe, it held symbolism for these visitors as the last point of "civilization". Writes Magoffin, “We are now at the great rendezvous of all the traders. [Council Grove](https://www.legendsofamerica.com/council-grove-kansas/) may be considered the dividing ridge between the civilized and barbarous, for now we may look out for [hostile Indians](https://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?id=803)” 

## Commerce in Kansa Territory 

People have populated the North American continent since 24,000 BCE, and there is archaeological evidence for people populating the central part of the North American continent since 4500 BCE. In the 19th century, tribes that lived in the territory later known as Kansas were the Kansa (after which the state was named), Osage, Kiowa, Comanche, Cheyenne, and Wichita. Trade between these groups and others on the continent was extensive - there is archeological evidence for trade with people in the region that later became California, with Mexico, and regions further east. (Berlo and Phillips)

Most trails originated as native american trails. (pull from Moor reading).  

Although the Spanish had traded with the plains natives since _______, traders from the United States to the east was a new phenomenon. What was unique about this time period of trade was its volume and method - these new traders found a lucrative market - the estimate is that $2 million was made between ___ and ________, and until Becknell in 1821, no one had used wagons on this route. 

A common idea for United states citizens beginning to trade in this territory is that it was unoccupied. (wide open spaces reading. Seeing map as empty has an advantage – can move in). ways natives used resources made it look unoccupied. 

Quote from Nathan howe – plus who he was. 


governement policy - 
people in Kansas bc of T of T?  
treaty with Kansa
Ways United States govenment protected these "foot soldiers of Manifest Destiny" (where is this from?) dragoons, etc. 

whatever risk the payoff was worth it for merchants

effect on native community - buffalo population. By ___ ? what did native and non-native communities look like? When LS town founded? 

Creating History 
how DAR put up markers
how when a generation is dying they want to preserve their memories and commemoration starts (what reading is this from?) 
Perhaps the significantce also given to the SF Trail by United States citizens is how its territories later became part of the US. Getting goods to soldiers/paving the way for annexation of territory, more states.
