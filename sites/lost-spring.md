Lost Spring was a crucial site for travelers on the Santa Fe Trail because of its water. A naturally occurring spring that sometimes flowed and sometimes didnt (hence the name 'lost'), Lost Spring helped travelers replenish a critical resource during their long journey.

## The Source

The source of water at Lost Spring is not the Rocky Mountains as in local legend, but the [Flint Hills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_Hills) to the east, a limestone and flint rock outcropping that was covered by sea during the Permian geologic period, about 300 million years ago. Because of the rockiness of this region farmers never disturbed the tallgrass prairie. It remains the largest contiguous grassland of its kind and is now an EPA designated [ecoregion](http://www.kansasnativeplantsociety.org/ecoregions.php) This undisturbed region is the source of 14 springs in Marion county, Kansas. At Lost Spring, as bedrock dips, water appears and later returns to the sandy soil of the site.  

One diarist’s 1848 description of it was, "Came to a place, called 'Lost Spring', a most singular curiosity. The stream rises suddenly out of the ground, and after rushing over the sand a few yards, as suddenly sinks, and is no more seen" (Richardson, 11). 

## Water Is Life
Usually travelers left in the cool of the evening carrying as much water as they could. Travelers used barrels and water kegs to transport this resource for use along the way, however, some wagons only carried one 5-gallon keg of water (Smith, 29). 

As the Santa Fe trail is 870 miles long, travelers had to replenish this resource as often as they could and finding sources along the way was crucial to survival. Water from springs was especially desirable, since it was cool and fresh, compared to water near trail crossings which were contaminated with animal waste, or pools which could be warm and stagnant. 

Aside from human consumption, animals were a consideration. Most wagons were pulled by oxen, and mules and horses were also used on the trail. Travelers also transported all manner of livestock, including cattle, sheep, and even pigs. Travelers caring for livestock had to time their travels so that grass and water would be available. 

The most dangerous part of the trail because of lack of water was called the “Jornada,” meaning expedition, a part of the trail 60 miles long between the Arkansas river and Wagonbed spring. 
William Becknell, one of the first to travel the trail, in 1821, supposedly ran out of water on this part of the trail. He and his team tried killing their dogs and cutting of their mules’ ears to drink their blood, so dehydrated were they. However, their expedition was saved when they spotted a bison gorged with water and drank from its stomach, later following its trail to a water source. 

Journals kept by travelers on the trail recount the prominent role searching for water had on their trail experience.  
The journal of Meredith Miles Marmaduke, an American politician who worked as a trader on the Santa Fe Trail, describes crossing the Jornada in 1824: 
>“Traveled 30 miles; left our encampment at 4 o’clock, a.m., and travelled without making any halt until about 4 o’clock p.m., without a drop of water for our horses or mules, by which time many of them were nearly exhausted, as well as a number of the men; a dog which had travelled with us during our journey, this day fell down and expired, such was the extreme heat and suffering. Fortunately for us all at about 4 o’clock a small ravine was discovered and pursued for a few miles, and after digging in the sand at the bottom of it, water was procured in sufficient quantity to satisfy both man and horse, but not till after five or six wells were sunk; and such was the extreme suffering of the animals that it was with utmost difficulty could be kept out of the holes until buckets could be filled for them. I have never in my life experience a time when such general alarm and consternation pervaded every person on account of the want of water.” 

Susan Shelby Magoffin, the plucky young bride of a merchant, traveling in 1846, also describes being far from water: “We traveled till 11 o’clock with the hope of finding water…the oxen staggered under their yokes. One poor thing fell in the road and we almost gave him up for lost. His driver, though, a rather tender hearted lad, I presume…got all the water from the water kegs after the men had drank and opening the ox’s mouth poured it down his throat.” The ox wandered off in the night still searching for water and was not retrieved. 

Another danger, besides running out of water, was being a visitor on lands that had been inhabited for thousands of years by others. Writes Magoffin, “We are now at the great rendezvous of all the traders. Council Grove may be considered the dividing ridge between the civilized and barbarous, for now we may look out for hostile Indians”
