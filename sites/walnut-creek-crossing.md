# Background

1855, six years before the American civil war, William Allison and Francis Boothe established a trading post along the imposing Arkansas river. This crossing came to be known as “Walnut Creek” an important milestone on the Santa Fe trail. Wagons traveling the trail would be forced to stop and set up camp along the river banks to wait out flooding. Thus it was the perfect site for a trading booth, and eventually a military post and toll booth. 

# Allison and Boothe

“Mr. Wm. Allison and Booth, known as famed prairie men, have determined to make a settlement at Walnut Creek on the Santa Fe road.” [^2]. Allison is said to have had only one arm [^7] , which raises questions on whether he was born that way or overcame remedial surgery. Allison and his partner Boothe were known for their prominent trading site. The post specialized in wolf killing and fur trading, as well as selling essentials to wagon travelers. 

# Conflict

“This settlement will be another stopping point on the route to New Mexico, and will make, in a little while, the road less dangerous, by lessening the distance between civilized points and affording those in danger or want an opportunity to obtain relief.”[^2] During these harrowing years, the Santa Fe trail was rife with tensions between cultural groups and conflicts were often reflected in the history of the site. In 1973 human remains were uncovered at Walnut Creek. Archaeologists concluded that 140 individuals were massacred by Kiowas warrier. Of the unfortunate travelers, one boy of fourteen survived the attack and spent the rest of his life showing off his scalped head in sideshows. 


# Ownership

Ownership of Walnut Creek trading post flipped around throughout the years it was utilized. Allison and Boothe, the original owners met their dark fate. Boothe was murdered by a Mexican or a disgruntled employee, and Allison followed a few years later of heart failure. Then ownership passes to George Peacock, who ran it successfully but was later murdered. The post was taken over by Charles Rath, and then by Joseph Douglas. While Douglas was in charge of what was by now a full blown store- it was raided and intentionally burned down. All that is left today at the site is the foundation of the store. William B. Parsons (in June, 1858) wrote: "This ranch is a large building strong enough to resist the attack of hundreds of Indians or white men, unless they have the assistance of artillery." [^1]. Despite this the store was raided and intentionally burned down. 




# Tribes

There were three mainly mentioned tribes that interacted with the site. Allison and Boothe had the lofty idea of interacting and selling items to Native Americans. Kiowas are translated to the “Principal people.” Historically people of the plains. Comanches which translates to “anyone who fights me all the time.” Historically from southern Great Plains. Arapahos are known historically as from Colorado and Wyoming.
