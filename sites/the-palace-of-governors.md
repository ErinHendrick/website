# The Palace of the Governors 

The palace of the Governors is located in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The building was constructed in 1610 under the rule of the newly appointed governor of the American Southwest Pedro De Peralta. This building then housed multiple governors and survived many events that shaped the Southwest. 

## Santa Fe during the 1600’s 

Santa Fe plays a huge part in Spanish history and some of the buildings are known to be some of the oldest of the United States. During the 1600’s the Spaniards conquered this area that was occupied by the Pueblo Indians. They began constructing buildings like the Palace of the Governors and they are structurally known for being built with adobe. New Mexico is known for having buildings and houses built from adobe. Life for the pueblo people was rough and most of them were enslaved by the Spaniards. 

## Pedro De Peralta

Pedro de Peralta was appointed as the second Spanish governor in 1610 by Luis De Velasco. He was a Spanish conquistador who came to the Americas from Spain. Under his law the construction of the palace began making him the original name behind this historic site. 

## Historical significance: 

This historic site served as the seat of the government for the Spanish colony Nuevo Mexico which included the modern states of New Mexico, Texas, Utah, Colorado, California, and Nevada. The palace is known for being one of the oldest public occupied buildings in the united states. The building is also significantly known as becoming one of the first territorial capitals when New Mexico was annexed as a U.S. territory. This building is known to have seen and survived many significant events that are important to the Southwest. 

## The Pueblo Revolt of 1680-1693:

In 1680 Pueblo Indians grew tired of the circumstances the Spaniards laid upon them which included forced labor, slavery, and conversion to Christianity with no say. Lead by a medicine man named Pope they planned an attack on the Spaniards residing in what is now Santa Fe, New Mexico. The Spanish troops gathered within the Palace and resisted attacks until the Pueblo Indians, after ten days cut off the water supply and forced the Spaniards to retreat to El Paso. The Pueblo people than took over the palace for the next twelve years and dramatically changed the interior of the palace to make it comfortable. “They pulled down the houses and the parish church and used the adobe bricks to fortify the Palace” (Author,Date). The palace was eventually taken back by the Spaniards under the control of Diego De Vargas in 1693. 

## The Palace Structure and Geography

The Palace of the Governors is an old-style adobe building that included many features important to the Spaniards. Inside the palace there were private apartments for the governors, official reception rooms, offices, military barracks, stables, and servants’ quarters. All these rooms were important for the running of the building and some original walls you can see to this day. Outside there were vegetable gardens that were planted on ten acres of land. Most importantly on the western part of the building served as a prison and a storage for the gun powder. The use of this building was either for the governor’s residency or to host important meetings or parties. 

## The New Mexico History Museum

This museum is just cattycornered to the palace of the governors and was built as a companion to the historical site. This museum includes a “permanent and temporary exhibitions that span the early history of indigenous people, Spanish colonization, the Mexican Period, and travel and commerce on the legendary Santa Fe Trail” (author,date). This museum adds to the physical space of the historic area brining tourists’ attention to the history of Santa Fe and the Palace of the Governors.  

## The Palace of the Governors Today

The palace today is strictly used as a museum where people can come and see the historic site it stands in a prominent place in the famous plaza. During the 1900’s the palace was officially going to be renovated into a museum and the renovations started in 1913 they wanted to highlight the Spanish-colonial features. The city of Santa Fe wanted to preserve the history that the palace held, but also make it appeal to people so they would like to visit. As you walk through the renovated palace you can tell what has been conveniently changed to be more modern and to fit the standards of Santa Fe and tourism. While there are many modern changes there are open areas of the walls where you can see the original walls where they stand between the new remodeled area. There is even a clear glass on the floor that shows the original flooring below the new one that was put in during the remodel. As you walk you can witness different histories and stories throughout about the Spaniards, pueblo people, and artifacts. There are different tours you can take at the museum one is a self-guided tour and the other is as guided when someone takes you around and tells you about the palace and history. There are over four hundred years of New Mexico history housed in the palace today as exhibits. The museum makes it easy to keep the history alive and preserve the past in the building. Outside of the palace on the patio there are vendors who sell Native American style jewelry to museum goers and tourists. This brings money to these people as well as interested eyes to this historic site.
